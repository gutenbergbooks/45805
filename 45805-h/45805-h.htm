<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>Unquestionably the chief interest of this
volume will centre in the three recently
recovered "lost" Tudor Plays: <i>Wealth and</i>
<i>Health</i>, <i>Impatient Poverty</i>, and <i>John the</i>
<i>Evangelist</i>. It was, in truth, a unique and
notable "find"&mdash;one that gladdened the
world's scholarship. In June 1906 it was
announced that no fewer than seventeen of
the rarest pre-Shakespearean interludes, including
three "lost" plays and four apparently
unknown or unrecorded editions, had been unearthed
in an Irish country house. Yet the
owner of this quarto volume of old plays,
the hammer value of which ultimately proved
to be over &pound;2600, thought so little, or knew so
little, of its value that it was sent over to the
London auctioneers without a cover!</p>

<p>It is a matter of surmise, perhaps idle
enough, how these old plays got so far afield
from the usual centres of early dramatic interest
and effort. Still it shows that we need not
despair of further "recoveries"; in the most
unlikely quarters and when least expected other
lost plays of the Tudor period may turn up;
and, it must be confessed, if only a tithe of
known plays not now traceable are restored,
the gain to scholarship will be invaluable.</p>

<p>Public interest in this recent recovery was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
at once aroused; and the contest for possession,
when brought to the hammer, was of the
keenest. Mr. Bernard Quaritch secured every
one. It is, however, a matter of profound
satisfaction to know that the rarest and best
items of the collection, the "lost" plays and
unrecorded editions, were bought for the
nation.</p>

<p>As a matter of record I may state that the
British Museum authorities secured&mdash;the prices
given are the hammer prices&mdash;<i>King Darius</i>
(unknown edition, &pound;132); <i>John the Evangelist</i>
(lost play, &pound;102); <i>The Nice Wanton</i> (unknown
edition, &pound;169); <i>Play of the Weather</i> (unknown
edition, &pound;90); <i>Wealth and Health</i> (lost play,
&pound;95); <i>Lusty Juventus</i> (unknown edition, &pound;140);
and <i>Impatient Poverty</i> (lost play, &pound;150).</p>

<p>America took <i>The Trial of Treasure</i> (&pound;160)
and <i>Apius and Virginia</i> (&pound;101). I have not,
however, as yet, been able to locate them
more definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. T. J. Wise purchased <i>Cambyses</i> (&pound;169)
and <i>Gammer Gurton's Needle</i> (&pound;180).</p>

<p><i>Octavia</i> (&pound;82) was purchased for Mr. J. H.
Wrenn.</p>

<p>Others were announced for sale by Mr.
Quaritch in his catalogue (No. 254) dated
Dec. 1906. The titles of these plays and the
auction price were: <i>Jacob and Esau</i> (&pound;148);
<i>The Tide Tarrieth for no Man</i> (&pound;176); <i>The</i>
<i>Disobedient Child</i> (&pound;233); <i>Youth</i>; and <i>The New</i>
<i>Custom</i> (&pound;155).</p>

<p>It is my good fortune in the present volume
to be the first to make the three "lost" plays
available for scholars. The greatest care has
been taken to furnish a faithful rendering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
the original texts; these have been set from
rotary-bromide photographs of the unique
copies now in national custody. Moreover, to
meet the requirements of "textual experts"
and the "higher criticism" these three plays
form the first series of my <i>Tudor Fascimile</i>
<i>Texts</i>, and will shortly be available in collotype.
The four "unknown" editions already noted
are also being reproduced by the same process
and will form Series <span class="smcap">II.</span> of the same collection.</p>

<p>Space&mdash;this volume is already much over-grown&mdash;forbids
further comment. Nor would
it be proper here and now. The recovery is
too recent to have afforded an adequate
opportunity for more than the most cursory
examination; indeed, my strong feeling has
been that I should best serve the wishes of
the subscribers to the Early English Drama
Society's publications by losing no time in
placing these texts before them.</p>

<p>The other early interludes which complete
the present collection are likewise rare and
more or less difficult of access.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Mercy.</i> The very Founder and Beginner of our first creation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among us sinful wretches He oweth to be magnified;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, for our disobedience, He had none indignation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To send His own Son to be torn and crucified.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our obsequious service to Him should be applied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where He was Lord of all, and made all thing of nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sinful sinner, to have him revived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for his redemption, set His own Son at nought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That may be said and verified: Mankind was dear bought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the piteous death of Jesu he had his remedy;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To this blessed Prince, that our nature doth glorify;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By meditation of our Lady, that is ever abundant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sinful creature that will repent his negligence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray God, at your most need, that Mercy be your defendant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In good works I advise you, sovereigns! to be perseverant;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To purify your souls that they be not corrupt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For your ghostly enemy will make his avaunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your good conditions if he may interrupt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! ye sovereigns that sit, and ye brothern that stand right up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pryke not your felicities in things transitory!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold not the earth, but lift your eye up!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There is none such food by water, nor by land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So precious, so glorious, so needful to our intent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it hath dissolved Mankind from the bitter bond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the mortal enemy, that venomous serpent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the which, God preserve you all at the last judgment!<br /></span>

<p class="center">THE PROLOGUE.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First, health and success, with many a good new year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wished unto all this noble presence here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have more t' entreat you of gentle sufferance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this our matter may have quiet utterance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, that are th' authors, have ourselves dedicate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some Christmas devise, your spirits to recreate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, our poet trusteth, the thing we shall recite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, without offence, the hearers' minds delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed, no man speaketh words so well fore pondered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the same, by some means, may be misconstrued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, nothing so well meant but that, by some pretence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be wrong interpreted from the author's sense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, let this be taken no worse than it is meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I hope nor we, nor our poet, shall be shent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now, of th' argument to touch a word or twain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of our play is Respublica, certain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our meaning is&mdash;I say not, as by plain story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as it were in figure by an allegory&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To show that all commonweals ruin and decay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From time to time hath been, is, and shall be alway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Insolence, Flattery, Oppression,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Avarice have the rule in their possession.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, though these vices, by cloaked collusion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by counterfeit names hidden their abusion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do reign for a while to commonweals' prejudice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perverting all right, and all order of true justice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet time trieth all, and time bringeth truth to light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wrong may not ever still reign in place of right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, when pleaseth God such commonweals to restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their wealth and honour, wherein they were afore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sendeth down His most tender compassion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cause truth go about in visitation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Verity, the daughter of sage old Father Time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheweth all as it is, be it virtue or crime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then doth Justice, all such as commonwealth oppress&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempered with mercy&mdash;endeavour to suppress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom, anon, is linked tranquillity and peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To commonweals' joy and perpetual increase.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But shall boys, (saith some now), of such high matters play?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No! not as discussers; but yet, the book doth say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ex ore infantium perferisti laudem.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, when Christ came riding into Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young babes, with th' old folk, cried out all and some:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Blessed be the man that in the Lord's name doth come!"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So, for good England's sake, this present hour and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hope of her restoring from her late decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We children, to you old folk, both with heart and voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May join all together to thank God, and rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That He hath sent Mary, our sovereign and queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reform th' abuses which hitherto hath been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that ills which long time have reigned uncorrect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall now, for ever, be redressed with effect.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is our most wise and most worthy Nemesis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom our play meaneth, t' amend that is amiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, to bring to pass, that she may have time and space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us, both young and old, to God commend her grace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, if you so please, I will go and hither send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall make you laugh well, if ye abide th' end.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or, who had not rather, his ill doings to hide,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The name of Policy is of none suspected&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, age cometh on; and what is a little gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep a man by drede that is feeble and old?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man, therefore, blame me though I would have more:<br /></span>

AND WORD-LIST</a></h3>


<p><i>Reference from text to Note-Book is copious, and as</i>
<i>complete as may be; so also, conversely, from Note-Book</i>
<i>to text. The following pages may, with almost absolute</i>
<i>certainty, be consulted on any point that may occur in</i>
<i>the course of reading; but more especially as regards</i></p>


<ul><li><i>Biographical and other Notes,</i></li>

<li><i>Bibliography,</i></li>
<li><i>Variorum Readings,</i></li>
<li><i>Words and Phrases now obsolete or archaic.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><i>The scheme of reference from Note-Book to text assumes</i>
<i>the division, in the mind's eye, of each page into</i>
<i>four horizontal sections; which, beginning at the top,</i>
<i>are indicated in the Note-Book by the letters a, b, c, d</i>
<i>following the page figure. In practice this will be found</i>
<i>easy, and an enormous help to the eye over the usual</i>
<i>reference to page alone in "fixing" the "catchword."</i>
<i>Thus 126a = the first quarter of page 126; 40c = the third</i>
<i>quarter of page 40; and so forth.</i></p>

<i>a</i> lust" (R<a href="#Page_212">212</a>,<i>c</i>) = he; (3) = one; (4) "a potful <i>a</i>
worts" (M<a href="#Page_13">13</a>,<i>c</i>) = of; (5) = on; (6) = have; (7) sometimes
used to lengthen a line, to accent a syllable, or
to make a rhyme-ending: also merely pleonastic.
For examples see other volumes of this series.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>b</i>) "azee" (R<a href="#Page_257">257</a>,<i>b</i>)&mdash;"A, zee!" (R<a href="#Page_267">267</a>,<i>a</i>),
look! see!</p></div>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Aband</span>, "if thou <i>aband</i> thee" (N<a href="#Page_48">48</a>,<i>c</i>), forsake,
abandon. "And Vortiger enforst the Kingdome
to <i>aband</i>."&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fairy Queen</i> (1590), ii. v. 63.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Able</span>, "zo chwas <i>able</i>" (R<a href="#Page_229">229</a>,<i>b</i>), fit, proper,
"fettled": in original <i>hable</i>&mdash;cf. <i>habile</i>. "Noye, to
me thou arte full <i>able</i>, And to my sacrifice acceptable."&mdash;<i>Chester</i>
<i>Plays</i> (c. 1400), i. 55.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adjutory</span>, "God will be you[r] <i>adjutory</i>" (M<a href="#Page_12">12</a>,<i>a</i>),
properly an adjective = helpful; the exigencies of
the rhyme has, however, apparently led to its use
substantively: the original manuscript, as indicated,
has "be yow <i>adiutory</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adventure</span>, see Joint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Affeed</span>, "<i>affeed</i> with them" (N<a href="#Page_70">70</a>,<i>a</i>), hired, engaged
with for profit: cf. <i>fee</i> (A.S.) = property, money,
annual salary, reward. "There is not a thane of
them but in his house I have a servant <i>feed</i>."&mdash;Shakespeare,
<i>Macbeth</i> (1606), iii. 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Affere</span>, "With his company myself <i>affere</i>" (N<a href="#Page_63">63</a>,<i>d</i>),
belong, be identified with, "of a kidney with."
"He was then buryed at Winchester in royall wise,
As to suche a prince of reason should <i>affere</i>."&mdash;Hardyng,
<i>Chronicle</i> (<i>d.</i> 1465), f. 106.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Affiance</span>, "Company of my <i>affiance</i>" (N<a href="#Page_78">78</a>,<i>a</i>),
close connection, affinity, trusted advisers or servants:
see other volumes of this series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Afine</span>, "well <i>afine</i>" (R<a href="#Page_261">261</a>,<i>d</i>), perfectly, thoroughly;
<i>i.e.</i> well a (= and) fine: a generic intensive. "Till
grapes be ripe and well <i>a-fine</i>."&mdash;Chaucer, <i>Romaunt</i>
<i>of the Rose</i> (1360), 3690.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Against</span>, "<i>against</i> I you call" (R<a href="#Page_199">199</a>,<i>b</i>), again: the
converse usage (<i>again</i> = against) was also common
enough in old writers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aged</span>, "some of them were <i>aged</i> ... one by one"
(R<a href="#Page_219">219</a>,<i>b</i>). Mr. Magnus thinks that in these lines
there must be some hint at the treatment of Bishops
Gardiner and Bonner, who were imprisoned and
their lands seized: see Respublica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albs</span>, "th' <i>albs</i> and amices" (R<a href="#Page_221">221</a>,<i>d</i>), a long white
linen garment or robe worn by officiating priests of
the Roman communion. It reached nearly to the
feet, and differed from the modern surplice (Rev.
H. J. Tod), inasmuch as it was worn close at the
wrists, similar to a bishop's lawn sleeves now-a-days.
"They (the bishops) shall have upon them in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
of their ministration, besides their rochet, a surplice
or <i>alb</i>, and a cope or vestment."&mdash;<i>Rubric of K.</i>
<i>Edw. VI.</i> (1548).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ale</span>, "mend ... as zour <i>ale</i> in summer" (R<a href="#Page_227">227</a>,<i>b</i>),
<i>i.e.</i> not at all: see Heywood, <i>Works</i> (E.E.D.S.),
<span class="smcap">II.</span>, 91<i>b</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algate</span>, "hath pleased thy noble grace <i>algate</i>"
(N<a href="#Page_48">48</a>,<i>a</i>), always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aliants</span>, "too many <i>aliants</i> in this realm" (WH
300,<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>), aliens. Foreign immigration seems
to have become a burning question early enough:
how dealt with history informs us; and posterity
has, in the main, confirmed the generally judicious
and far-sighted policy of welcome extended to
refugees and others, with its consequent introduction
of new blood, new ideas, new crafts, and the benefits
arising therefrom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alise dicts</span> (R<a href="#Page_210">210</a>,<i>b</i>), <i>i.e.</i> <i>alias dicta</i>. People's
manglement of both English and Latin phrases is
a noteworthy characteristic of the play&mdash;see Divum,
Captivity, Commediens, Enquest, Policate, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>, "then am I <i>all</i> safe" (R<a href="#Page_241">241</a>,<i>d</i>), quite, entirely.
"Woe to the bloody city! it is <i>all</i> full of lies and
robbery."&mdash;<i>Nah.</i> iii. 1. <i>Bible</i>, Auth. Vers. (1611).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allectuous</span>, "<i>allectuous</i> ways" (M<a href="#Page_33">33</a>,<i>d</i>), alluring,
enticing: <i>allective</i> is a commoner form. "Woman
yfarced with fraude and disceipt, To thy confusion
most <i>allective</i> bait."&mdash;Chaucer, <i>Rem. of Love</i>, ver. 14.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allow</span>, "these words be greatly to <i>allow</i>" (N<a href="#Page_59">59</a>,<i>a</i>),
approve, sanction: American by survival. "First,
whether ye <i>allow</i> my whole device&mdash;And if ye like it,
and <i>allow</i> it well."&mdash;Norton and Sackville, <i>Gorboduc</i>
(1570. 1), 94,<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (E.E.D.S.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All thing</span>, "<i>all thing</i> hath prospered" (R<a href="#Page_201">201</a>,<i>b</i>)&mdash;"<i>All</i>
<i>thing</i> I tell you" (R<a href="#Page_202">202</a>,<i>c</i>)&mdash;"<i>all thing</i> should
soon be well" (R<a href="#Page_208">208</a>,<i>d</i>), everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aloft</span>, "look <i>aloft</i> with th' hands under the side"
(R<a href="#Page_192">192</a>,<i>d</i>), <i>i.e.</i> Insolence when presented to Respublica
as the captain of the marauding crew is to assume
a butter-will-not-melt-in-my-mouth expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amically</span>, "he hath <i>amically</i>' directed" [(R<a href="#Page_237">237</a>,<i>d</i>),
amicably, in a friendly fashion. "An <i>amical</i> call to
repentance and the practical belief of the Gospel."&mdash;W.
Watson, M.A., 1691, in A. Wood, <i>Ath. Ox.</i>,
2nd ed., vol. ii., col. 1133.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amices</span>, "th' albs and <i>amices</i>" (R<a href="#Page_221">221</a>,<i>d</i>), a piece of
fine linen worn by officiating priests: it was oblong-square
in form, folded diagonally. It covered the
head, neck, and shoulders, and was buckled or
clasped before the breast, and when the altar was
reached was thrown back upon the shoulders. It
forms the uppermost of the six sacerdotal garments,
the others being the alb, cingulum, stole, manipulus,
and the planeta. The amice is still worn under the
alb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span>, "follow his appetite <i>among</i>" (N<a href="#Page_49">49</a>,<i>c</i>), in company&mdash;elliptical:
see other volumes of this series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amromes</span>, "books <i>Amromes</i>" (JE<a href="#Page_356">356</a>,<i>b</i>), so in original.
I can suggest nothing beyond a misprint for "amorous";
but, in that case, why the capital <i>A</i>? A
line (or lines) may also be missing at this point, the
connection being not at all obvious. However,
there is nothing to suggest a break, the printing
being unusually regular and clear at this point in
the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anch</span>, "<i>anch</i> hear om" (R<a href="#Page_230">230</a>,<i>b</i>)&mdash;"<i>anch</i> can spy my
time" (R<a href="#Page_231">231</a>,<i>c</i>), for <i>an ich</i> = if I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angel</span>, (<i>a</i>) "an <i>angel</i> for a reward" (R<a href="#Page_264">264</a>,<i>b</i>). Mr.
Magnus thinks that here is enshrined a play on the
proper meaning of the word, and <i>angel</i> = a coin of
the realm.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>b</i>) see Angelot.</p></div>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Angelot</span> (R<a href="#Page_216">216</a>,<i>d</i>). Mr. Magnus in his note (E.E.T.S.
ed., p. 67, line 768) seems to identify this coin with
the angel. He may be right; but on the other
hand, it is not out of place to point out that in
numismatics an angelot is generally regarded as an
ancient French coin first struck at Paris when that
capital was in English occupation (1420). It bore
on it the figure of an angel supporting the escutcheon
of England and France. The angel of Edward VI.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
was a gold coin, named from the fact that on one
side of it was a representation of the Archangel
Michael in conflict with the Dragon (Rev. xii. 7).
The reverse had a ship with a large cross for the
mast, the letter E on the right side and a rose on
the left; whilst against the ship was a shield with the
usual arms. Angels were first struck in France in
1340, and were introduced into England by Edward
IV. in 1465. Between his reign and that of Charles
I. it varied in value from 6s.8d. to 10s. The last
struck in England were in the reign of Charles I.&mdash;H.
Noel Humphreys, <i>Coins of England</i>, 5th ed.,
1848; and other authorities. <i>Angelots</i> (<i>i.e.</i> half the
value of an angel), were also struck by Edward VI.
in 1550: see Edwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annexion</span>, "the soul hath his <i>annexion</i>" (M<a href="#Page_38">38</a>,<i>c</i>),
conjunction: Shakespeare in <i>The Lover's Complaint</i>
employs it in the sense of <i>addition</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anointed</span>, "two knaves <i>anointed</i>" (N<a href="#Page_113">113</a>,<i>d</i>), thorough-paced,
"out-and-out"; a double pun is intended
the references being to <i>anointed</i> = beaten, with an eye
on <i>anointed</i> = consecrated by the pouring on of oil.
"Then thay put hym hout, the kyng away fly,
Which so well was <i>anoynted</i> indede, That no sleue ne
pane had he hoe of brede."&mdash;<i>The Romans of Partenay</i>
(ed. Skeat), 5652-4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apaid</span>, "very well <i>apaid</i>" (WH<a href="#Page_280">280</a>,<i>c</i>), glad, satisfied, pleased, paid. "They buy thy help: but sin ne'er
gives a fee, He gratis comes; and thou art well
<i>appay'd</i>, As well to hear as grant what he hath
said."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> (1594), l. 913.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appair</span>, "I say his wealth doth mend, he saith it
doth <i>appair</i>" (R<a href="#Page_226">226</a>,<i>b</i>), becomes worse, degenerates.
"All that liveth <i>appaireth</i> fast."&mdash;<i>Everyman</i>, Anon.
Pl. 1 S. (E.E.D.S.), 94,<i>d</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apple</span> (<a href="#Page_19">19</a>,<i>d</i>), in original <i>a nappyl</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Applied</span>, "to Him should be <i>applied</i>" (M<a href="#Page_3">3</a>,<i>b</i>), given,
rendered, one's heart or mind fixed upon: the only
sense of <i>apply</i> in the English Bible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apply</span>, see Aged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apprehensible</span>, "was not <i>apprehensible</i>" (M<a href="#Page_33">33</a>,<i>a</i>),
competent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appropriations</span>, "bare parsonages of <i>appropriations</i>"
(R<a href="#Page_218">218</a>,<i>d</i>), technically, at law (according to Blackstone,
<span class="smcap">I.</span> 11) an <i>appropriation</i> is the transference
to a religious house, or spiritual corporation, of the
tithes and other endowments designed for the
support of religious ordinances in a parish; also
these when transferred. When the monastic bodies
were in their glory in the Middle Ages they begged,
or bought for masses and obits, or in some cases
even for actual money, all the advowsons which
they could get into their hands. In obtaining these
they came under the obligation either to present a
clergyman to the church, or minister there in holy
things themselves. They generally did the latter,
and applied the surplus to the support and aggrandisement
of their order. On the suppression of the
monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII. the appropriated
advowsons were transferred to the king, and
were ultimately sold or granted out to laymen, since
called <i>impropriators</i>. See Respublica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Array</span>, (<i>a</i>) "<i>array</i> toward" (R<a href="#Page_258">258</a>,<i>d</i>), <i>i.e.</i> preparations
in progress. (<i>b</i>) "nice in their <i>array</i>" (M<a href="#Page_14">14</a>,<i>b</i>), dress, equipment, outward appearance. "But for to telle
you of his <i>aray</i>, His hors was good, but he ne was
nought gay."&mdash;Chaucer, <i>Cant. Tales</i> (1383), Prologue, 73-4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ascite</span>, "I <i>ascite</i> you ... to appear" (IP<a href="#Page_342">342</a>,<i>c</i>),
summons, call. "Hun answered that the infant
had no propertie in the shet, wherupon the priest
<i>ascited</i> him in the spiritual courte."&mdash;Hall, <i>Henry
<span class="smcap">VIII.</span></i>, f. 50.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aspen-leaf</span>, "tir-tremmeleth as the <i>aspen-leaf</i>"
(M<a href="#Page_32">32</a>,<i>c</i>), an early example of a common simile. The
text, "tir-trimmeleth," etc., is as in original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay</span>, <i>subs.</i> and <i>verb</i>, "<i>assay</i> him I will" (M<a href="#Page_11">11</a>,<i>a</i>),&mdash;"<i>at</i>
<i>all assays</i>" (M<a href="#Page_7">7</a>,<i>c</i>), as <i>verb</i> = try, tempt, essay;
as <i>subs.</i> = at all points, in every respect. "I will
<i>assay</i> ere long."&mdash;<i>Jacob and Esau</i>, Anon. Pl. 2 Ser.
(E.E.D.S.), 15<i>d</i>; "at all <i>assays</i>" (<i>Ibid.</i> 53<i>b</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assemble</span>, "I <i>assemble</i> the life" (N<a href="#Page_89">89</a>,<i>b</i>), compare,
liken: cf. Shakespeare's use of <i>assemblance</i>.&mdash;"Care
I for the limb, the thewes, the stature, bulk, and big
<i>assemblance</i> of a man!"&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>2 Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span></i>

<p><span class="smcap">Attempt</span>, "Ye must <i>attempt</i> the world" (N<a href="#Page_59">59</a>,<i>d</i>),
try, "sample," experience: cf. Shakespeare, <i>Lear</i>,
ii. 2.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Attemptates</span>, "immoderate <i>attemptates</i>" (R<a href="#Page_266">266</a>,<i>a</i>),
attempts, endeavours: specifically to commit a
crime. Puttenham, in 1589, said this word was a
recent importation, but it had already been in use
half a century at least. "To forbear that <i>attemptate</i>."&mdash;Sadler

(M<a href="#Page_15">15</a>,<i>b</i>), badge. Princes, noblemen, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
gentlemen of rank had formerly, and still retain,
distinctive badges, and servants and dependants
wore these cognisances on their liveries. Douce,
in his <i>Illustrations of Shakespeare</i> (1839), pp. 205-7,
says: "The history of the changes which badges
have undergone is interesting. In the time of
Henry IV. the terms <i>livery</i> and <i>badge</i> seem to have
been synonymous. A badge consisted of the
master's device, crest, or arms on a separate piece
of cloth, or sometimes on silver in the form of a
shield fastened to the left sleeve. In Queen Elizabeth's
reign the nobility placed silver badges on
their servants. The sleeve badge was left off in
the reign of James I., but its remains are still preserved
in the dresses of porters, firemen, and water-men,
and possibly in the shoulder-knots of footmen.
During the period when badges were worn the coat
to which they were affixed was, as a rule, blue, and
the blue coat and badge still may be seen on parish
and hospital boys."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baggage</span>, "the <i>baggage</i>, the trash," etc. (R<a href="#Page_183">183</a>,<i>c</i>),
rubbish, refuse, trumpery, scum. "Fill an egg-shell
newly emptied with the juice of singreen, and
set it in hot embers; scum off the green <i>baggage</i>
from it, and it will be a water."&mdash;Lupton, <i>Thousand</i>
<i>Notable Things</i> (1579).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bags</span>, "the names of my <i>bags</i>" (R<a href="#Page_221">221</a>,<i>a</i>), purses:
those carried by Avarice were probably, for the
sake of "business," more like small sacks; he is
represented as hugging them (<a href="#Page_216">216</a>,<i>a</i>), as hauling
them (<a href="#Page_215">215</a>,<i>d</i>), and as dragging them out (<a href="#Page_225">225</a>,<i>d</i>).
" ... see thou shake the <i>bags</i> Of hoarding abbots;
imprison'd angels Set at liberty."&mdash;Shakespeare,
<i>King John</i> (1596), iii. 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bale blisses</span> (JE<a href="#Page_355">355</a>,<i>c</i>), probably blisses which are
evil, and the reverse of blisses; with an eye on A.S.
<i>bale</i> = "fiery"; as in <i>bale</i>-fire, etc. "... bring me
forth toward <i>blisse</i> with se <i>bale</i> here."&mdash;<i>MS. Cott.</i>,
<i>Titus</i>, D. xviii., f. 146<i>b</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bales</span>, "lay on with your <i>bales</i>" (M<a href="#Page_6">6</a>,<i>a</i>). "Scared
us with a <i>bales</i>" (M<a href="#Page_35">35</a>,<i>d</i>), in the first example the
manuscript has <i>ballys</i>, in the second <i>bales</i>, but I
think the context in each case shows the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
to be the same. <i>Bales</i> = a rod or scourge, and
specifically a bow: at 6,<i>a</i> it is the minstrels who
are charged to "lay on."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ball</span>, "to it Boy, box him <i>Ball</i>" (R<a href="#Page_194">194</a>,<i>c</i>), a dog:
cf. 195,<i>d</i>. Halliwell says the name was given to
various animals: "it is mentioned as the name of
a horse in Chaucer and Tusser, of a sheep in the
<i>Promptorium</i>, and of a dog in the Privy Purse
Expenses of Henry VIII., p. 43."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banket</span>, see Junkery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baudery</span>, "sorcery, witchery, <i>baudery</i>" (R<a href="#Page_263">263</a>,<i>d</i>),
the manuscript has <i>bandery</i>, but? <i>baudery</i> as in
present text. If <i>bandery</i>, plotting is doubtless
meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bash</span>, "look thou not <i>bash</i>" (JE<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>a</i>), <i>i.e.</i> timidly,
or with too much inattention. "No, Leonato, I
never tempted her with word too large, But, as a
brother to his sister, shew'd <i>Bashful</i> sincerity and
comely love."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Much Ado</i> (1600), iv. <span class="smcap">I.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bast</span>, "begat the whoreson in <i>bast</i>" (N<a href="#Page_68">68</a>,<i>b</i>), fornication,
adultery. "For he was bigeten o <i>baste</i>, God it
wot."&mdash;<i>Artour &amp; Merlin</i>, 7643.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Be</span> (<i>passim</i>), been.</p>

see other volumes of this series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bees</span>, "hive of humble <i>bees</i> swarming in my brain"
(R<a href="#Page_182">182</a>,<i>c</i>), proverbial: cf. modern "bee in the bonnet."
Here = restless, whimsical, full of projects: see Heywood,
<i>Works</i> (E.E.D.S.), <span class="smcap">II.</span> 385; <i>s.v.</i> Head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beforn</span>, <span class="smcap">Beforne</span> (<i>passim</i>), before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bells</span>, "one would think 'twere brass, most part
on't was made of our old <i>bells</i>" (R<a href="#Page_232">232</a>,<i>b</i>). People
states an historical fact, and refers to the reformation
of the coinage which occurred in the previous
reign. Under Edward VI. (1547-53) the Protector
Somerset reduced the coinage to its true
value and the export of bell-metal was forbidden
(2 &amp; 3 Edw. <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, c. 37). The pence of the coinage of
1552 (the fourth of the reign, other issues having
been made in 1546-47, 1548, and 1550: see Respublica)
was both of fine and base metal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
<i>fine</i> penny has (on the obverse) the king seated,
with arms and cross on the reverse. The <i>base</i>
penny has a full-blown rose (the Tudor rose) instead
of the enthroned king. Half-pence are nearly the same as the pence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belly</span>, "when the <i>belly</i> is full the bones would be
at rest" (R<a href="#Page_216">216</a>,<i>b</i>), proverbial: see Heywood,
<i>Works</i> (E.E.D.S.), <span class="smcap">II.</span> 55,<i>b</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benefices</span>, "the fifth I have by selling of <i>benefices</i>"
(R<a href="#Page_221">221</a>,<i>b</i>). "I have a good <i>benefice</i> of a hundred
marks" (R<a href="#Page_225">225</a>,<i>b</i>)&mdash;"they will take no <i>benefice</i>, but
they must have all" (R<a href="#Page_225">225</a>,<i>b</i>), references apparently
to the prevalence of simony. Although a bill had
been passed by a parliament of Edward VI., it did
not receive the royal assent; and it was not until
1588-89, under Elizabeth, that any serious attempt
was made to remedy the evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berwick</span> (R<a href="#Page_254">254</a>,<i>a</i>), in original <i>Barwicke</i>, to rhyme
with "Warwicke."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besene</span>, "so well <i>besene</i>" (N<a href="#Page_117">117</a>,<i>b</i>), good appearance,
comely. "And sad habiliments right <i>well beseene</i>."&mdash;Spencer,
<i>Fairy Queen</i> (1590), <span class="smcap">I.</span> xii. 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besirance</span>, "chwas <i>besirance</i> your ladydom to zee"

<p><span class="smcap">Bet</span>, "could not a counselled us <i>bet</i>" (M<a href="#Page_35">35</a>,<i>c</i>), better.
"Perhaps he shall be <i>bet</i> advisde within a weeke or
twayne."&mdash;"Romeus and Juliet," <i>Supp. to Sh.</i>, i. 292
(Nares).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bezeivers</span>, "valse <i>bezeivers</i>" (R<a href="#Page_230">230</a>,<i>a</i>), deceivers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bide</span>, "had <i>bide</i> ne'er so little longer" (R<a href="#Page_257">257</a>,<i>b</i>)
bided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bird's arse</span>, "clean as a <i>bird's arse</i>" (M<a href="#Page_22">22</a>,<i>b</i>), a proverbial
simile not uncommon in old writers: Heywood
varies it&mdash;"as bare," etc. (<i>Works</i>, E.E.D.S.,
<span class="smcap">II.</span>, 89,<i>a</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blane</span>, "without <i>blane</i>" (WH<a href="#Page_294">294</a>,<i>b</i>), ceasing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blench</span>, "to <i>blench</i> his sight" (M<a href="#Page_23">23</a>,<i>d</i>), deceive, hinder, obstruct. "The rebels besieged them,
winning the even ground on the top, by carrying
up great trusses of hay before them, to <i>blench</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
defendants' sight, and dead their shot."&mdash;Carew,
<i>Survey of Cornwall</i> (1602).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blest</span>, "God's dear <i>blest</i>" (IP<a href="#Page_316">316</a>,<i>c</i>), <i>i.e.</i> happy or
blessed, "people" being understood. Also bliss,
happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blin</span>, "of thy prayer <i>blin</i>" (M<a href="#Page_25">25</a>,<i>b</i>), cease, stop.
"How so her fansies stop&mdash;Her tears did never

(Nares).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bloodings</span> (R<a href="#Page_221">221</a>,<i>a</i>), black (or blood) puddings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blottibus</span>, etc. (M<a href="#Page_30">30</a>,<i>b</i>), kitchen Latin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Board</span>, <span class="smcap">Bourd</span>, "I will <i>board</i> her" (R<a href="#Page_195">195</a>,<i>b</i>)&mdash;"to
<i>bourd</i> Respublica" (R<a href="#Page_200">200</a>,<i>b</i>). Mr. Magnus says "to
engage in tilting," but is not the sense that of
Fr. <i>aborder</i> = to accost, address, woo. The spelling
in the present text should, of course, have been
uniform. "I am sure he is in the fleet; I would
he had <i>boarded</i> me."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Much Ado</i>, ii. <span class="smcap">I.</span>
" ... for, sure, unless he knew some strain in me,
that I know not myself, he would never have <i>boarded</i>
me in this fury."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Merry Wives of</i>
<i>Windsor</i>, ii. <span class="smcap">I.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boat</span>, "an oar in everybody's <i>boat</i>" (R<a href="#Page_235">235</a>,<i>c</i>): see
Heywood, <i>Works</i> (E.E.D.S.), <span class="smcap">II.</span>, 24,<i>b</i>; 207,<i>a</i>; 417,<i>c</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolt</span>, "my <i>bolt</i> is shot" (M<a href="#Page_34">34</a>,<i>d</i>), an arrow: for
examples of the proverb, see Heywood, <i>Works</i>
(E.E.D.S.), <span class="smcap">II.</span> 58,<i>d</i>; 91,<i>a</i>; 205,<i>d</i>; 332,<i>d</i>; 370,<i>c</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bolt</span>, "sift and <i>bolt</i>" (R<a href="#Page_207">207</a>,<i>d</i>), the legal sense is probably intended rather than redundancy for the
rhyming's sake. Oppression means that matters
must be gifted and discussed privately in order to
improve their opportunities for rascality. "And
having performed the exercises of their own houses
called <i>boltes</i>, <i>mootes</i>, and putting of cases, they
proceed to be admitted and become students, in
some of these four houses or innes of court, where
continuing by the space of seven yeares (or there-aboutes)
they frequent readings, meetings, <i>boltinges</i>,
and other learned exercises."&mdash;Stowe, <i>Survey of</i>
<i>London</i>, p. 59. "The judge, or jury, or parties,
or the counsel, or attornies, propounding questions,
beats and <i>bolts</i> out the truth much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Bones</span>, see Belly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boot</span>, "he will be my <i>boot</i>" (M<a href="#Page_11">11</a>,<i>a</i>), help, remedy,
cure. "Ich haue <i>bote</i> of mi-bale."&mdash;<i>William of</i>
<i>Palerne</i> (<i>c.</i> 1300), 627. "God send every trewe man
<i>boote</i> of his bale."&mdash;Chaucer, <i>Cant. Tales</i> (1383),

<p><span class="smcap">Bord</span>, "we did but <i>bord</i>" (WH<a href="#Page_298">298</a>,<i>a</i>), jest: see

<p><span class="smcap">Boys</span>, "shall <i>boys</i> ... of such high matters play"
(R<a href="#Page_180">180</a>,<i>d</i>). Mr. Magnus asks whether this reference
to "boy-chorister-actors" may not "have some
special reference to Edward <span class="smcap">VI.'S</span> theological precocity."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brast</span>, "the halter <i>brast</i> asunder" (M<a href="#Page_27">27</a>,<i>c</i>; also
28,<i>d</i>), burst. "But with that percing noise flew open
quite, or <i>brast</i>."&mdash;Spenser, <i>Fairy Queen</i> (1590), <span class="smcap">I</span>.
viii. 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brat</span>, "a whole <i>brat</i> to his back" (IP<a href="#Page_338">338</a>,<i>d</i>), cloak,
mantle. "Ne had they but a shete Which that
they might wrappen hem in a-night, And a <i>bratt</i> to
walken in by day-light."&mdash;Chaucer, <i>Cant. Tales</i>
(1383), 16,347.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breadibus</span>, "<i>breadibus ... horsibus ... firibusque</i>"
(M<a href="#Page_5">5</a>,<i>b</i>), for bread, for horses, and for fires: a form,
of dog-Latin which has always been, and still is,
popular: see Misericordia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brethel</span>, "and thy own wife <i>brethel</i>, and take thee
a leman" (M<a href="#Page_27">27</a>,<i>a</i>), <i>brethell</i> in original: the E.E.
text editors suggest [<i>be</i>] <i>brethell</i>, that is, "if thy
own wife be adulterous." This, however, seems
beside the mark of the context, as why should Mankind
be counselled to take a whore because his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
wife is unchaste? May <i>brethel</i> not be a mis-script
for A.S. <i>betelle</i> (Halliwell)=to deceive? The
meaning is then clear enough and the reading sound.
On the other hand, I fail to find any authority for
Halliwell's suggestion <i>betelle</i>=deceive, mislead, in
either Anglo-Saxon or M.E. dictionaries, and the
<i>r</i> in the word brethel, perhaps precludes the adoption
of betelle, <i>r</i> being a highly characteristic letter.
An alternative suggestion is that brethel is meant
for <i>brechell</i>, from <i>breken</i>, to break, to injure, to vex,
harass, torment, or destroy. "Breken" has among
its derivatives "brac," "brake," "brek," "breche,"
"briche," "bruche," "bruchel."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brenning</span>, "hot and <i>brenning</i>" (N<a href="#Page_122">122</a>,<i>a</i>), burning:
also <i>brent</i>=burnt: see other volumes of this series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brest</span>, "till his belly <i>brest</i>" (M<a href="#Page_6">6</a>,<i>a</i>), burst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brim</span>, "<i>brim</i> and hot" (R<a href="#Page_241">241</a>,<i>d</i>). Magnus glosses
this "brimhot": but cf. <i>brim</i>=well-known, spoken
of, public. "That thou dost hold me in disdain,
Is <i>brim</i> abroad, and made a gibe to all that keep
this plain." Warner, <i>Albion's England</i> (1586-1606).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bum vay</span> (R<a href="#Page_211">211</a>,<i>d</i>), by my faith: original spelling <i>vei</i>:
cf. Fr. <i>foi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunting</span>, "how think you by this <i>bunting</i>" (R<a href="#Page_216">216</a>,<i>d</i>),
Mr. Magnus glosses this "swelling"; but is it
not a term of endearment, perhaps with an eye
on the diminutive form of <i>bunt</i>="a swelling part,
an increasing cavity, the bagging of a fishing net
or the like" (<i>Ency. Dict.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burrs</span>, "cleave together like <i>burrs</i>" (M<a href="#Page_193">193</a>,<i>a</i>), proverbial.</p>

upwards of two centuries: see other volumes of

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>b</i>) "<i>hangman of Calais</i>" (JE<a href="#Page_359">359</a>,<i>a</i>), this mention

agreement, bargain; but here, as Mischief is speaking
of the food and other cheer he has stolen,
the meaning may be gain, booty, plunder, spoil.

were funning and punning, I have preserved the
play on the words which I think was intended&mdash;<i>chope</i>
= ch'ope (I hope) and <i>chop</i> = cut off; but the

to mean "cut!" "strike!" "<i>Chope</i> you'll consider

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas device</span> (R<a href="#Page_179">179</a>,<i>b</i>), Christmas was better
kept as a festival in olden times than in modern
days, lasting at this period from Christmas Eve to
Old Christmas Day or Twelfth night. At Court,
and in the Inns of Court, high revel was kept; from
references such as the above it is clear that many
a play was specially written for, and first presented
at, these festivals. The sources of detailed descriptions
are too well known to need particular reference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas song</span> (M<a href="#Page_15">15</a>,<i>d</i>; 16,<i>a</i> to <i>c</i>). Prof. Manly

of course, as do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Church</span>, "a <i>church</i> here beside," etc. (M<a href="#Page_28">28</a>,<i>b</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the

<p><span class="smcap">Clawback</span>, "you flearing <i>clawback</i> you" (R<a href="#Page_188">188</a>,<i>a</i>),
lickspittle, flatterer. The whole passage is a striking

gradual piling up of the weight of abuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clean</span>, "a clean gentleman" (M<a href="#Page_22">22</a>,<i>a</i>), fair, comely,

<p><span class="smcap">Cobs</span>, "the great <i>cobs</i>" (R<a href="#Page_232">232</a>,<i>d</i>), a rich but grasping

<p><span class="smcap">Convinced</span>, "they shall be <i>convinced</i>" (R<a href="#Page_246">246</a>,<i>b</i>),
convicted: cf. convict. "Which of you <i>convinceth</i>
me of sin?"&mdash;<i>Bible</i>, Auth. Vers. (1611), <i>John</i> viii. 46.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coped</span>, (<i>a</i>) "Christ's <i>coped</i> curse" (M<a href="#Page_36">36</a>,<i>a</i>); in original
<i>coppyde</i>: cf. <i>copie</i>, <i>copy</i> = abundance, plenty (Trevisa,
i. 301), and <i>copped</i>, <i>coppyd</i> = rising to a point,
heaped-up as a measure; hence "Christ's <i>copious</i>,
abundant, overflowing malediction." "This
Spayne ... hath grete <i>copy</i>, and plente of castelles."&mdash;<i>Trevisa</i>,
i. 301.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>b</i>) "he is so <i>copped</i>" (R<a href="#Page_213">213</a>,<i>a</i>), apparently a

<p><span class="smcap">Courtesy</span>, "the <i>courtesy of England</i> is oft to kiss"
(JE<a href="#Page_356">356</a>,<i>d</i>). In <i>The English Historical Review</i> (vol.
vii., p. 270) there is an article by Major Martin A.S.
Hume on "Philip's visit to England" in 1554. The
article is founded on a Spanish account written by
Andres Mu&ntilde;oz, a servant in the household of Don
Carlos, Philip's son, then a child. Mu&ntilde;oz did not
himself go to England, but probably got his account
from someone, much in the same position as himself,
who did go. The writer describes how Philip met
Queen Mary at Winchester, "<i>and kissed her on the</i>
<i>mouth, in the English fashion</i>." On taking leave
Philip was introduced to Mary's ladies, all of whom
he kissed "<i>so as not</i> (says Mu&ntilde;oz) <i>to break the custom</i>
<i>of the country, which is a very good one</i>." This no
doubt explains the passage in the play, but there was
at law another <i>courtesy of England</i> with which,
in the origins, it may have some obscure connection.
Cowel, in his <i>Law Dictionary</i> (1607), describes a
tenure by which, if a man marry an inheritrix,
that is, a woman seised of land, and getteth a child
of her that comes alive into the world, though both
the child and his wife die forthwith, yet, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
were in possession, shall he keep the land during
his life, and is called tenant <i>per legem Angli&aelig;</i>, or
by the <i>courtesy of England</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Courtnals</span>, "a zort of <i>courtnalls</i>" (R<a href="#Page_255">255</a>,<i>d</i>), courtiers:
in contempt (Halliwell).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court spiritual</span> (IP<a href="#Page_343">343</a>,<i>b</i>), Abundance was accused
of fornication, and so came under ecclesiastical
jurisdiction. These courts were made separate
to the Secular or Civil Courts in 1085, but until the
establishment of the Divorce and Probate Courts in
1857 the Ecclesiastical Courts took cognisance of
blasphemy, apostasy, heresy, schism, ordinations,
matters pertaining to benefices, matrimony, divorces,
bastardy, tithes, incest, fornication, adultery, probate
of wills, administrations, and similar matters
(Haydn).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Creance</span>, "chief of His <i>creance</i>" (N<a href="#Page_45">45</a>,<i>d</i>), ordinarily
faith, belief, credit, payment: I subjoin examples
of each usage, but neither seem to fit the sense. There
is an alternative which is nearer the mark, in the
Latin <i>creans</i>, pr. p. of <i>creo</i>, to create; but I find
no authority beyond <i>creant</i>, which, as far as I know,
is modern: see last example. "This mayden tauzte
the <i>creance</i> Unto this wyf so perfitly."&mdash;Gower, <i>MS.</i>
<i>Soc. Antiq.</i> 134, f. 66. "And with his precyous
bloode he wroote the bills Upon the crosse, as general
acquytaunce To every penytent in ful <i>creaunce</i>."&mdash;<i>Rom.</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculorum</span>, "taken with a <i>cuculorum</i>" (JE<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>d</i>),
the rhyming exigency no doubt influenced the form
of the word, but in any case the use is obscure,
probably slang now lost. Whether, however, it
originated in <i>cucullus</i>, a hood, or <i>cuculus</i>, a cuckoo
(whence cuckold), or whether the word enshrines a
play on both, I cannot say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>, see Respublica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curia</span>, etc. (M<a href="#Page_30">30</a>,<i>c</i>), the proceedings of Manorial Courts
were generally headed "<i>Curia</i> generalis tenta

date.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cut</span>, "Call me <i>cut</i>" (N<a href="#Page_54">54</a>,<i>b</i>), properly a gelding or any
animal with a short or cut tail, and specifically an
intensive reproach. The classical illustration to the
present passage is, of course, from Shakespeare, "If
I tell thee a lie, spit in my face and call me horse"
(<i>1 Hen. IV.</i>, ii. 1). Compare again, "cutted whore"

<p><span class="smcap">Draff</span>, "driff, <i>draff</i>, mish, mash" (M<a href="#Page_5">5</a>,<i>b</i>), rubbish,

<p><span class="smcap">Drouse</span>, "a hounded <i>drouse</i>" (WH<a href="#Page_288">288</a>,<i>d</i>), in view of
the wretched printing of this play it serves little
useful purpose to suggest a correct reading; the
most probable would seem to be <i>hounded</i> = hundred
and <i>drouse</i> = douse; <i>i.e.</i> a god give him a hundred
duckings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwards</span>, "angelots and <i>Edwards</i>" (R<a href="#Page_216">216</a>,<i>d</i>), see
Angelots. I am further inclined to doubt whether
the pieces referred to were of current or recent
striking. It is true Edward VI. reformed the coinage,
but as the angelots (at least) are specifically referred
to as "old," and as the angelot is probably that
of 1420, the <i>Edward</i> is also likely to be the angel of
Edward IV. introduced in 1465, which bears an effigy
of that king. The angel of Edward VI., of the third
coinage of the reign, <i>does not bear an effigy of Edward VI.</i>
It may not be out of place to detail the various issues,
though this cannot, of course, settle the point as to
what coin was meant by the <i>Edward</i>. Kenyon, on
"The Gold Coins of England," says there were four
distinct series of <i>gold</i> coins issued during the reign
of Edward VI. <i>First Coinage</i> (<i>January 1546-47</i>):&mdash;<span class="smcap">Half-sovereigns</span>
(value 10s.). <i>Obverse</i>&mdash;king in robes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
and crowned, enthroned, the figure of an angel on
each arm of the throne; <i>reverse</i>&mdash;shield bearing
arms of France and England quarterly, supported by
lion and dragon. <span class="smcap">Crown</span> (value 5s.). <i>Obverse</i>&mdash;rose,
crowned; <i>reverse</i>&mdash;shield with arms, crowned. <span class="smcap">Half-crowns</span>
(value 2s. 6d.). Type like the crowns.
<i>Second Coinage</i> (1548):&mdash;<span class="smcap">Treble Sovereign</span> (value
&pound;3). Type like last half-sovereign, except that king
has no robes, and holds a sword instead of a
sceptre. <span class="smcap">Sovereign</span> (value &pound;1). Same as &pound;3, only with
different mint-mark. <span class="smcap">Half-sovereign</span> (value 10s.).
<i>Obverse</i>&mdash;bust in profile to right; <i>reverse</i>&mdash;oval
shield, crowned, and garnished. <span class="smcap">Crowns</span> (value
5s.). Same as half-sovereign of this coinage.
<span class="smcap">Half-crowns</span> (value 2s. 6d.). Same as half-sovereign
of this coinage. <i>Third Coinage</i> (1550):&mdash;<span class="smcap">Double</span>
<span class="smcap">Sovereign</span> (value 48s). <i>Obverse</i>&mdash;king
seated, holding sceptre and orb; <i>reserve</i>&mdash;shield
with arms, upon a large double rose. <span class="smcap">Sovereign</span>
(value 24s.). Same as double sovereign. <span class="smcap">Angel</span>
(value 8s.). Type similar to angels of Henry
<span class="smcap">VIII</span>. The type seems to have been fixed in Henry
<span class="smcap">VI</span>.'s reign. The Archangel Michael was on the
<i>obverse</i>, trampling with his left foot upon the dragon,
and piercing him through the mouth with a spear.
<i>Reverse</i> has shield bearing arms of England and
France upon a ship. [<i>No effigy of Edward <span class="smcap">VI</span>.</i>]
<span class="smcap">Angelet</span> (value 4s.). Same as angel. <i>Fourth</i>
<i>Coinage</i> (1552):&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sovereign</span> (value 20s.). <i>Obverse</i>.&mdash;three-quarter
length of king in profile; <i>reverse</i>&mdash;same
as sovereign of second coinage. <span class="smcap">Half-sovereign</span>
(value 10s.). <i>Obverse</i>&mdash;same as sovereign; <i>reverse</i>&mdash;square
shield crowned between E.R. <span class="smcap">Crown</span> (value
5s.). Same as half-sovereign. <span class="smcap">Half-crown</span> (value
2s. 6d.). Same as crown. Hawkins, on "The Silver
Coins of England," says of Edward <span class="smcap">VI</span>. <span class="smcap">Silver</span>

Exactly the same as the shilling. <span class="smcap">Threepence</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
Same as shilling. <span class="smcap">Pence</span> of this coinage (1552)
occur both of fine and base metal. The <i>fine</i>
penny has (on the <i>obverse</i>) the king seated, with
arms and cross on the <i>reverse</i>. The <i>base</i> penny has
a full-blown rose, instead of the enthroned king.
<span class="smcap">Half-pence</span> are nearly the same as pence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Empery</span>, "in this <i>empery</i>" (N<a href="#Page_56">56</a>,<i>d</i>), empire, dominion;
also more loosely, region. "Ruling in large and

(1599), i. 2. "A lady So fair, and fastened to an

<p><span class="smcap">Emprise</span>, "th' <i>emprise</i> of all this world" (N<a href="#Page_46">46</a>,<i>a</i>),

<p><span class="smcap">Erch</span> (<i>passim</i>), ere I&mdash;er' 'ch&mdash;ere ich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escheats</span>, "the blind <i>escheats</i>" (R<a href="#Page_183">183</a>,<i>d</i>), lands or
tenements which fell to the crown or lord of the
fee through failure of heirs or corruption of blood:
the latter kind was abolished by the Felony Act,
33 &amp; 34 Vict., ch. xxiii. "The last consequence
of tenure in chivalry was <i>escheat</i>; which took place
if the tenant died without heirs of his blood, or if
his blood was corrupted by commission of treason
or felony. In such cases the land escheated or fell
back to the lord&mdash;that is, the tenure was determined
by breach of the original condition of the feudal
donation. In the one case there were no heirs of
the blood of the first feudatory, to which heirs alone
the grant of the feud extended; in the other the
tenant, by perpetrating an atrocious crime, forfeited
his feud, which he held under the implied condition
that he should not be a traitor or felon."&mdash;Blackstone,
<i>Commentaries</i>, bk. ii., ch. 3.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exaltations</span>, "follow their good <i>exaltations</i>" (R<a href="#Page_234">234</a>,<i>d</i>),

<p><span class="smcap">Extent</span>, "at the highest <i>extent</i>," etc. (R<a href="#Page_219">219</a>,<i>a</i>), sale
under compulsory powers (M).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extreats</span>, "the scape of extreats" (R<a href="#Page_183">183</a>,<i>d</i>), <i>i.e.</i>
estreats, enforced by trick. At law an estreat is an
official copy of the specification of fines or penalties
(such as a forfeited recognisance for use of the
bailiff or sheriff's officer in levying). "A forfeited
recognisance," if taken by a justice of the peace, "is
certified to the next sessions; and if the condition
be broken by any breach of the peace in the one case,
or any misbehaviour in the other, the recognisance
becomes forfeited or absolute; and being <i>estreated</i>
or extracted, taken out from among the other records,
and sent up to the Exchequer; the party and
his sureties, having now become absolute debtors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
of the Crown, are sued for the several sums in which
they are respectively bound."&mdash;Blackstone, <i>Comment.</i>,
bk. iv., ch. 18. See Respublica for authorities dealing
with the systems of extortion referred to in
these lines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faitour</span>, "ye are no <i>faitour</i>" (M<a href="#Page_12">12</a>,<i>c</i>), deceiver,

<p><span class="smcap">Farthing</span>, "I may not change a man a <i>farthing</i>"
(M<a href="#Page_18">18</a>,<i>b</i>), in the least or smallest degree. A farthing,
the fourth part of a penny, and the smallest copper
coin current in Great Britain, is mentioned as far
back as Robert of Gloucester. It seems to have
become a simile of small value or amount in most
early writers. "In hire suppe was no <i>ferthing</i> sene

<p><span class="smcap">Fetches</span>, "beware the <i>fetches</i> of Tediousness"
(WS<a href="#Page_143">143</a>,<i>a</i>), stratagems, tricks, contrivances, artifices:

meaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fichant</span>, "Ise cannot be <i>fichant</i> enough" (R<a href="#Page_267">267</a>,<i>c</i>),

Mr. Magnus glosses this "flyxe [<i>flixe</i> in E.E.T.S.
text], flick, thief, 62, 1908." The mistake in giving
the text spelling in glossary leads one to suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
that all the rest, save the page and line reference, is
wrong also. At all events, how could Avarice "die of
the thief"? Perhaps, however, the E.E.T.S. editor
meant the Great Thief of Thieves&mdash;Old Age!!

<p><span class="smcap">Geoffrey</span>, "farewell, gentle <i>Geoffrey</i>" (M<a href="#Page_9">9</a>,<i>a</i>),
apparently a common tag or catch-phrase, or from
some song of the period. Heywood (<i>Works</i>, E.E.D.S.,
<span class="smcap">II.</span> 36<i>b</i>) quotes almost the identical words of <i>Mankind</i>:
"Now, here is the door, and there is the way;
And so, (quoth he), farewell, gentle <i>Geoffrey</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gere</span>, read Gear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gesumme</span>, "a good horse should be <i>gesumme</i>" (M<a href="#Page_12">12</a>,<i>d</i>).
Dr. Bradley (quoted by E.E.T.S. editors) suggests
<i>geason</i> (A.S. <i>g&oelig;sne</i> = empty, scarce). The whole
passage from the beginning of the speech is obscure
and apparently corrupt: at all events, it hardly
"reads" as it is. The following suggestion is made
with a view to eliciting a re-examination. The
original is (E.E.T.S.)&mdash;</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Green Friars</span> (N<a href="#Page_92">92</a>,<i>d</i>), no such order is known either
to the highest living English authority on monastic
orders, or to Helyot or Dugdale; <i>The Catholic Dictionary</i>
likewise makes no reference to Green Friars.
And, in truth, having regard to the context, it seems
tolerably certain that Medwall (a priest himself)
was merely satirizing known abuses, with an eye
perhaps on "Friar Tuck" and "Lincoln green":
the "hedge-marriages" alluded to later (<a href="#Page_93">93</a>,<i>c</i>) would
also support this interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Groge, Groged</span> (N<a href="#Page_75">75</a>,<i>d</i>), grudge, grudged: as <i>subs</i> =

<p><span class="smcap">Halfpenny</span>, "your minds were all on your <i>halfpenny</i>"
(R<a href="#Page_196">196</a>,<i>d</i>), <i>i.e.</i> with an eye to the main chance,
generally attentive, cautious, or prudent. The
proverb is in Heywood (<i>Works</i>, E.E.D.S., <span class="smcap">II.</span> 14,<i>c</i>;
174,<i>b</i>). "<i>Ri.</i>: Dromio, looke heere, now is my

<p><span class="smcap">Halsed</span>, "his fair wife <i>halsed</i> in a corner" (M<a href="#Page_28">28</a>,<i>d</i>),
embraced (<i>hals</i> = neck): the special use of the word
is singularly appropriate, as Mischief had just escaped
the halsman (= executioner or jailer) himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hance Beerpot</span> (W.H.), <i>i.e.</i> Hans, but there was

curse: cf. "over the left" = altogether wrong, or

colloquialisms are by no means rare to express
insincerity, ill-omen, underhandness, or inferiority.
The earliest quotation in the <i>O.E.D.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> Left, is
1705, so this example carries its use back upwards
of 200 years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hardely</span> (<i>passim</i>), steadily, boldly, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hare</span>, "this same way goeth the <i>hare</i>" (R<a href="#Page_212">212</a>,<i>b</i>),
<i>i.e.</i> that's the gist, trend, secret, why and wherefore
of the matter: in Heywood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassard</span>, "fet not <i>hassard</i> nor rioter" (IP,320,<i>c</i>);
so in original. It may be a contraction of <i>hasarder</i>
= gamester, or a misprint for <i>haskard</i> = a rough,
blustering fellow (Dekker); probably, however,
the former fits the context best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hasse</span>, "a fair manor <i>hasse</i>" (JE<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>a</i>), so in original;
and but for the rhyme-word <i>bash</i> being spelt <i>basshe</i>
one might suspect a misprint, especially as Dr.
Murray records no such form as <i>hasse</i> for <i>house</i>, nor
anything like it. The meaning, however, is clear
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hat</span> (<i>passim</i>), have it&mdash;ha[ve i]t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haut, Hauty</span>, "his <i>haut</i> courage" (N<a href="#Page_60">60</a>,<i>d</i>),&mdash;"Wealth
is <i>hauty</i>" (WH<a href="#Page_276">276</a>,<i>d</i>), high, lofty, proud. Also
see N<a href="#Page_53">53</a>,<i>c</i>, where <i>haut</i> is misprinted <i>hawt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> (<i>a</i>) (<i>passim</i>) bears several idiomatic meanings
in old writers. Thus <i>to have after</i> = to follow; <i>to</i>
<i>have at</i> (a person or thing) = to try, attempt, begin,
strike, hit; <i>to have with</i> (a person) = to go with,
come on. Also, <i>have at him</i> (subs.) = a thrust, blow;
and so forth. "<i>Have after</i>, to what issue will this
come."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet</i> (1596), i. 4. "<i>Have at</i>
<i>it</i>, then."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Cymbeline</i> (1605), v. 5.
"<i>Have at thee</i> with a downright blow."&mdash;Shakespeare,

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Haviour</span>, "a man of your <i>haviour</i>" (N<a href="#Page_85">85</a>,<i>b</i>), conduct,
manners, demeanour, as in Shakespearean usage.
But possibly it may, and probably does, stand
here for the Anglo-Norman <i>havoir</i> = wealth, property.
The context would seem to indicate this,
"Into a <i>haviour</i> of less fear."&mdash;Shakespeare, <i>Cymbeline</i>
(1605), iii. 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hawt</span>, see Haut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Headibus</span>, "your headibus" (M<a href="#Page_18">18</a>,<i>c</i>), heads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heal</span> (<i>passim</i>), health.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Hedge</span>, "over the <i>hedge</i> ere ye come at the stile"
(R<a href="#Page_192">192</a>,<i>a</i>), proverbial: in Heywood (<i>Works</i>, E.E.D.S.,
II. 97,<i>d</i> and 443,<i>c</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heels</span>, see Lead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helpen</span>, "he can be <i>helpen</i> thereof" (N<a href="#Page_122">122</a>,<i>a</i>), helped;
also <i>holpen</i>. Still in use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hend</span>, "to me full <i>hend</i>" (M<a href="#Page_11">11</a>,<i>c</i>), courteous, civil,
polite. "So loveth she this <i>hendy</i> Nicholas."&mdash;Chaucer,
<i>Cant. Tales</i> (1383), 3386.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hey</span>, "<i>Hey nonny nonny, ho for money</i>" (R<a href="#Page_222">222</a>,<i>d</i>),
if not a popular song, a popular refrain. The words
occur in many old writers, not infrequently with
an obscene meaning or reference: see <i>Slang and its</i>
<i>Analogues, s.v.</i> Nonny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hie</span>, "<i>Hie</i> you forth lively" (M<a href="#Page_17">17</a>,<i>d</i>), probably a
snatch of some old song, which, however, I have
been unable to trace. A somewhat similar reference
occurs in <i>Misognus</i> (Anon. Plays, 2 Ser., E.E.D.S.,
185,<i>d</i>) during a dancing scene: "O lively with
high, child, and turn thee; ah, this is good sport!"
Although this does not settle the source of the
saying, yet it adds force to Mankind's words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">High</span>, "on <i>high</i>, on <i>high</i>" (JE<a href="#Page_357">357</a>,<i>c</i>), a duplication
necessitated by the rhyme&mdash;<i>Eli, Eli</i>, but all the
same a very striking one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hight</span>, "Health I <i>hight</i>" (WH<a href="#Page_277">277</a>,<i>a</i>), am called,
have for a name: the only passive verb in English:
see other volumes of this series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hip</span>, "have you on the <i>hip</i>" (R<a href="#Page_215">215</a>,<i>c</i>), to have or
get an advantage: see <i>Slang and its Analogues,</i>
<i>s.v.</i> Hip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hite</span>, "when man is a little <i>hite</i> and wealthy" (WH<a href="#Page_279">279</a>,<i>c</i>)
= idle: in original <i>hit</i>. I take the word to be akin
to the northern <i>hite</i>, to run up and down idly (Halliwell).
Still, this may be wrong, and the now
obsolete sense of <i>hit</i> = to be fortunate or successful
may be meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ho</span> (<i>passim</i>) is used in varying senses in all old writers.
Thus <i>Ho!</i> = a command to stop, cease, or refrain
from the continuance of any action. Hence, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
verb = to cry out, shout, etc. Whence many
colloquialisms. <i>To be ho</i> (JE<a href="#Page_367">367</a>,<i>a</i>) = to be restrained,
stopped, delayed; <i>out of all ho</i> = out of all bounds or
restraint; <i>no ho with</i> = restive of control, out of
hand; <i>let us ho</i> = let us stop; and so forth. <i>Ho,</i>
<i>ho, ho!</i> occurs in many old plays, being given to the
devil or vice when making an entry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holpen</span>, "if it be <i>holpen</i>" (N<a href="#Page_54">54</a>,<i>b</i>), helped: see
Helpen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holyke</span> (M<a href="#Page_16">16</a>,<i>c</i>). From the nature of the song
itself it must be inferred that a triple pun was
intended, <i>Holy</i> (sacred refrain)&mdash;<i>wholly</i> (holelyche
= wholly)&mdash;<i>Hole-lick</i> (osculare fundamentum):
probably the "roof" was intended to be "raised"
by the medley of interpretations thus offered, the
business of each of the chorus being different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holy nation</span> (JE<a href="#Page_357">357</a>,<i>b</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the Saints and redeemed.
The reference to love and virginity is apparently
founded on a passage in Revelations, attributed
by many to St. John the Evangelist: see <i>Rev.</i> xi.
4, and John Evangelist, p. 416 <i>ante</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hood</span>, "his hair groweth through his <i>hood</i>" (IP<a href="#Page_340">340</a>,<i>c</i>;
also R<a href="#Page_229">229</a>,<i>d</i>), <i>i.e.</i> comes to poverty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hook</span>, "by <i>hook</i> or by crook" (R<a href="#Page_187">187</a>,<i>b</i>), by some
means or other, by fair means or foul, at all hazards,
probably of forestal origin. "Their work was by
<i>hook or crook</i> ... to bring all under the emperor's
power."&mdash;Thomas the Rymer, <i>On Parliaments</i> (<i>d.</i>
1298).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horse</span>, (<i>a</i>) "<i>horse</i> with four ears" (JE<a href="#Page_364">364</a>,<i>a</i>), apparently
a reference to some form (or rather means)
of punishment&mdash;the gallows (or mare with three
legs), the pillory, or the timber-mare (or horse)
for flogging purposes. Probably the latter, as its
construction would justify the "four ears" of the
text.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Impatient Poverty</span>. The text will be found on pages
311-348. Hitherto little indeed seems to have
been known concerning this interlude. As far as I
can learn no copy has been traceable, at all events
in modern days, until "the Irish find" was put up
at Sotheby's in July 1906. Part of this "recovery"
(see Preface) was a copy of <i>Impatient Poverty</i>, which
is now national property in the custody of the
trustees of the British Museum, the price paid for
the item being no less than &pound;150. It is true that
the title, together with one or two details of the
baldest description, occur in most catalogues of
early English plays, from that of Rogers and Ley
in 1656 down to Mr. W. W. Greg's "hand-list"
prepared for, and issued by, the Bibliographical
Society in 1900. It is, however, an obvious fact
that in each case all the authorities appear to quote
from mention only. Further, though "known"
to a similar extent to latter-day critics&mdash;to Collier,
Halliwell, Hazlitt, Fleay, Ward, Gayley, Brandl,
Greg, and Pollard&mdash;all these, likewise, quote either
from an early mention, or from one another; none
seem to have seen a copy of the play. Dyce alone
was explicit. In a note to <i>Sir Thomas More</i> (Shakes.
Soc., p. 55) he records <i>Impatient Poverty</i> as "non-extant."
After an interval of more than sixty
years since Dyce wrote, and 350 years or more
after publication, the "lost" play has been recovered;
and it is now my good fortune to make
it generally accessible to scholars. The British
Museum Catalogue entry is as follows:</p></div>

have been "newly" printed in 1560 by John King,
who was in business at the Sign of the Swan in St.
Paul's Churchyard from 1555 to 1561. There is no
entry in the Stationers' Register for the year 1560 or
earlier. The British Museum copy is a tolerably well-printed
black-letter quarto of its kind; it is also in
excellent preservation. A reduced facsimile of the
title-page is given on page 311, but unfortunately
the paper used in these volumes is not altogether
suitable for illustrative work. The old copy is,
however, announced among <i>The Tudor Drama</i>
<i>Facsimile Texts</i>, and will shortly be available in
collotype. The collation is A to Eii in 4s (18 leaves).
The first sheet (A) has no signature, but the others are
regular in notation. <i>Impatient</i> (= intolerable, unendurable)
<i>Poverty</i> is by an unknown author, but a very
shrewd attribution might even now be made were not
the time, as yet, hardly ripe for scientific deductions.
The materials are not at hand for anything like a
systematic study of pre-Shakespearean dramatic
effort and achievement; and the study of isolated
plays can, at best, lead to imperfect and perhaps
erroneous conclusions. Unquestionably, however,
the Tudor drama deserves to be studied, as Shakespeare
is now-a-days studied: as a whole, and not
piecemeal. But&mdash;alack and alack!&mdash;where is the
accessible material for such an inquiry? Still, if
at present we do not know the author's name, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
can nevertheless learn something of him from his
play. He was evidently a sedate man, serious to
a degree, with apparently deep-seated religious
principles: note the long-sustained exhortations
and the general tone of the play. It is also noteworthy
that, for the period, the bawdry is "cut"
to the lowest limit. There are no women's parts,
and the Vice is a watered-down specimen of his
class. There is little internal evidence to enable one
to form an idea of the date of composition, though
this may, I think, be fixed as probably not earlier
than 1545, but before 1552. The allusions to usury
seem to point to a period anterior to the repeal by
Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> in 1552 of the Usury Act of 37
Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, which was re-enacted by Elizabeth
in 1570. Yet the reference to "the Queen" (<a href="#Page_347">347</a>,<i>d</i>),
unless a later interpolation, is obviously to Queen
Elizabeth, and not to Queen Mary. The play is
too distinctly and settled Protestant&mdash;indeed, the
tone is even that of "the new learning" victorious&mdash;to
admit of a Marian chronology. In this latter
case the downward limit would be extended at
least to 1558. Other allusions are likewise scanty
or unilluminating&mdash;"Joy and solace be in this
hall" (<a href="#Page_321">321</a>,<i>a</i>), seems suggestive of a College or Inns
of Court audience, as distinguished from a purely
Court performance; the joining of simony with
covetise (<a href="#Page_325">325</a>,<i>c</i>) recalls the Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> Act against
simony (1552); "Conscience, the high judge of the
law" (<a href="#Page_328">328</a>,<i>b</i>), is reminiscent of <i>Respublica</i>: cf. 227,<i>d</i>;
other references are to Newgate, Tyburn, the Fleur
de Lys, etc., but they do not appear to have any
special meaning. The present text is transcribed
direct from a rotary-bromide copy of the original,

hope, be found as accurate as human care can

sense (= an ape-like, pert, or ridiculous person)
is obscure. Dr. Murray says that so far as yet
found the word appears first as an opprobrious
nickname of William de la Pole, the Duke of Suffolk
who was murdered in 1450, whose badge was a
clog and chain such as was attached to a tame
ape. Thus in contemporary poems (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Pol. Poems</i>,
<i>c.</i> 1499 [Rolls], <span class="smcap">II.</span> 222) several noblemen are designated
by their badges, Suffolk being named the
"ape-clogge." We find <i>Jack-napes</i> generic for an
ape in Skelton (1522), and shortly afterwards the
term was current in the present and more common
sense. But the connection between <i>Jack Napes</i>

<i>Evangelist</i> was looked upon as one of the innumerable
"lost" plays of the Tudor period. It has
now been recovered under the notable circumstances
narrated in the preface to this volume. Curiously
enough, <i>John the Evangelist</i> was at first, in the
sale catalogue, confused with Bishop Bale's <i>John</i>
<i>Baptist's Preaching in the Wilderness</i>, no copy of
which also is now traceable, being known only
through the reprint in the <i>Harleian Miscellanies</i>.
However, there is no doubt that if a choice of "finds"
had to be made the lot would fall to the present play,
which has been untraceable in any form, save that of
mere mention, for hundreds of years. The British
Museum Catalogue entry is:</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="smcap">John Saint and Apostle.</span> Here begynneth the
interlude of Johan the Evangelist [with a woodcut].
B.L. John Waley, London [1560?]. 4<sup>o</sup>.
[c. 34. i. 20.]</p></div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Greg, in his "notes" to <i>Early Play Lists</i> (App. <span class="smcap">II.</span>
lxxix), says: "Neither Langbaine nor any of his
followers had seen the piece. The <i>Biographica</i>
<i>Dramatica</i> gives the date 1566, which, however,
appears to be an invention of Chetwood's." The
colophon indicates that it was printed by John
Waley (or Walley), who was in business in Foster
Lane from 1546 to 1586. This, of course, decides
nothing as to the date of the play. Moreover,
there is, as far as I am at present aware, only one
allusion in the play itself that serves the purpose;
even allowing more weight to such evidence
than I am inclined to consider safe in the circumstances&mdash;Eugenio
appoints Actio (<a href="#Page_359">359</a>,<i>a</i>) "hangman
of Calais." It is hardly likely such an allusion
to what was at the time regarded as a national
"disaster" would have been made after the loss of
Calais in 1558. On the other hand, the absence
of the concluding prayer for the sovereign&mdash;its
presence being a pretty certain indication of an
Elizabethan play&mdash;seems to confirm the downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
limit of date. One other allusion may be pertinent&mdash;"the
sweetest life, Sovereign ... is to have
meditation of our Lord Jesus." A Marian date is,
from the tone of the play, unlikely; to suppose the
reference is to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> is equally incongruous.
Both considerations are, moreover, emphasised by
the fact that had the "Sovereign" been a queen,
regnant or dowager, some qualification indicative
of sex would in such courtly times most assuredly
have been given. We are thus reduced, by the
process of exhaustion, to the days of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>:
<i>i.e.</i> between 1547 and 1553. Beyond that point I
do not think we can safely go at present. The
play, as now bound by the British Museum authorities,
shows no signs of mutilation, and the numbering
of the sheets is consecutive. The type is, for the
most part, clear and good; nothing obliterated,
very little blurred, and only occasionally is there
exhibited a wrong letter (<i>e.g.</i> "laue" for "lane");
but as a whole very correct. The construction of the
play is of the slightest, turning at its most serious
point on the incident of "The Pharisee and the
Publican going up to the Temple to pray." Indeed,
the whole piece seems curiously incomplete and
disconnected. Yet there are no signs whatever,
in the original, of mutilation or of lines omitted.
The text goes straight on, though the relation of one
part to another is by no means obvious. Is it possible
that the play as it has reached us is only a draft,
or an imperfect, or a "pirated" copy? I am inclined
on first glance to think this interlude one of
the same class as those that Bishop Bale speaks of
as being played at market crosses on Sunday afternoons
by way of religious instruction&mdash;"thin,"
slight moral plays. Indications are not wanting
which point to this conclusion. Such a fact, if
established, would account for the transparent looseness
of construction, the deep religious feeling, the
reticence and restraint, the apparent confusion of
one of the players at once with the apostle, the parish
priest, and the actor&mdash;and much else. The original
is almost devoid of punctuation; the modernised text
conforms in that respect to present-day standards.
The names of the speakers are likewise not always
consistently given in the old copy; they are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
standardised. <i>Latin Quotations and Origins</i>: It is
thought convenient, in respect to this play, to group
these as follows:&mdash;"<i>Domine, ante ... absconditus</i>"
(<a href="#Page_351">351</a>,<i>b</i>), "Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my
groaning is not hid from thee" (Psalm xxviii. 9):
in original <i>a te</i> is omitted after <i>Et</i> in second
line&mdash;<i>Beati</i> <i>.. . Domine!</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>a</i>), "Blessed, O Lord,
are they that dwell in Thy house" (Psalm lxxxiv. 4)&mdash;"<i>Qui</i>
<i>cum Deo Patri</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>a</i>), "Who with God
the Father," the beginning of an ascription or gloria&mdash;"<i>A</i>
<i>p&oelig;na et culpa</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>b</i>), from penalty and
fault: part of the Latin absolution&mdash;"<i>Nec te
collaudas</i> <i>.. . ipse</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>c</i>), the sense is, "You will
not be blamed so long as you don't extol yourself"&mdash;"<i>Qui</i>
<i>se collaudit</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>c</i>), "Who praises himself";
probably from same source as preceding&mdash;"<i>Responde,</i>
<i>tunc. .. clericorum</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>d</i>), "Answer
then, master, doctor of the clergy"&mdash;"<i>Sursum</i>
<i>corda</i>" (<a href="#Page_353">353</a>,<i>a</i>), "Lift up your hearts"; from the
office of the mass&mdash;"<i>Via recta</i>" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>a</i>), "the right
way"&mdash;"<i>Spes mea. .. via recta</i>" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>a</i>), "My
hope stood in the right way" (or way of righteousness):
several passages like this in sense appear in
the Psalms, but none exactly parallel&mdash;"<i>gratia</i>
<i>electi</i>" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>b</i>), "chosen by grace"&mdash;"<i>via
obliquia</i> <i>.. . circularis</i>" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>c</i>), "the crooked way and
circular way": no doubt scriptural&mdash;"<i>omnes iniquo</i>
<i>in circuitu impii ambulantes</i>" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>c</i>), <i>iniquo</i> in
original reads <i>iniqui</i>, which I take to be a misprint:
it now reads, "all the ungodly walking in the ungodly
path" (or path of ungodliness): probably from
the Psalms&mdash;"<i>Ab aquilone. .. omne malum</i>"
(<a href="#Page_355">355</a>,<i>a</i>), "from the north is spread every evil":
a parallel passage is found in Jeremiah iv. 6, "I
will bring evil from the north," etc.&mdash;"<i>Fumus</i>
<i>tormentorum. .. secula seculorum</i>" (<a href="#Page_355">355</a>,<i>d</i>), in
original <i>fumus</i> reads <i>finit</i>, most likely a misprint:
the passage as it now stands is intelligible, "The
smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever;
a quotation from Revelation xiv.
11&mdash;"<i>Septum</i> <i>.. . mors</i>" (<a href="#Page_355">355</a>,<i>d</i>), <i>Septum</i> conveys the idea of
a surrounding fence or hedge (cf. 355,<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>),
"the enclosing (or surrounding) master of sin is
death; but?&mdash;"<i>administrate. .. comfortate nos</i>"
(<a href="#Page_356">356</a>,<i>c</i>), dog-Latin: "administers, restores, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>forts"&mdash;"<i>Intentio</i>
<i>judicat quenquam</i>" (<a href="#Page_357">357</a>,<i>a</i>),
"The intention decides everything"; no doubt
proverbial&mdash;"<i>In principio</i>" (<a href="#Page_364">364</a>,<i>d</i>), "in the beginning":
the first two words of the Latin version
of St. John's Gospel&mdash;"<i>Confiteor</i>". .. <i>Deo
gratias</i> <i>.. . Deo gratias ago tibi</i>" (<a href="#Page_366">366</a>,<i>b</i>), "I confess ...
thanks be to God ... God I thank thee": see
Luke xviii. 11&mdash;"<i>Tu testimonium. .. est verum</i>"
(<a href="#Page_367">367</a>,<i>a</i>), "Thou bearest testimony of thyself; and
thy testimony is not true"; an adaptation of John
viii. 13&mdash;"<i>Qui vivit. .. seculorum secula</i>" (<a href="#Page_368">368</a>,<i>a</i>),
"Who lives through the infinite ages of age."
<i>Amended Readings, Corrigenda, Suggestions, &amp;c.</i>
The collation is A to Civ in 4s, with A1,<i>v</i> blank.&mdash;Names
of Players are not in the original.&mdash;The
colophon is transferred from Civ,<i>v</i>&mdash;Stage directions
and words in brackets do not appear in the original:
this is not further mentioned in these notes&mdash;"<i>Et</i>
a te <i>gemitus</i>" (<a href="#Page_351">351</a>,<i>b</i>), <i>a te</i> not in original&mdash;"As it
<i>ravisheth</i> the soul" (<a href="#Page_351">351</a>,<i>c</i>), original <i>rauysshet</i>&mdash;"such
a pulpit man to <i>lose</i>" (<a href="#Page_352">352</a>,<i>b</i>), original <i>lese</i>&mdash;"<i>Reponde</i>,

same death <i>thou shalt</i> die" (<a href="#Page_353">353</a>,<i>a</i>), erroneously
given in my text: the original has <i>shalt</i>
<i>thou</i>&mdash;["<i>The continuation seems imperfect</i>"], there
may be several causes for this. Certainly here, as
in other places, there are no signs whatever in
original of mutilation or of lines omitted. The
text goes straight on, though the relation of one
part to another is by no means obvious. The
whole play seems curiously incomplete and scrappy,
even for early dramatic effort, oftentimes of the
"thinnest" and crudest. True, the action may be
modelled somewhat on the lines of Heywood's
<i>Pardoner and the Friar</i>, in which the "interruptions"
of one speaker with another lead to "business."
Or the play may be a mere fragment of the
"book," as it left the author's hands&mdash;surreptitious,
unauthorised, or unrevised. In the former case,
especially assuming that it was intended as a kind of
a "dramatic sermon," the action shows order of a
kind: commencing with what is obviously intended as
the commencement of an exhortation and omitting
the "comic" and "lighter" parts, the sermon
would, in a measure, be naturally complete by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
"following on" the speeches as follows: <i>St. John</i>
<i>the Evan.</i> 351,<i>b</i> to 352,<i>a</i>; <i>Irisdision</i>, 353,<i>c</i> (with asides,
incentives, or interruptions) to 356,<i>a</i>; <i>St. John the</i>
<i>Evan.</i> 357,<i>b</i> to 358,<i>a</i>; then comes an "interval," and
the discourse is resumed at (JE<a href="#Page_365">365</a>,<i>c</i> to end) winding
up with the "application" which was soon to form
such an important feature in Puritan worship. So
for the point directly at issue; but another puzzle
confronts the student and one concerning which at this
early stage I do not pretend to offer a solution. Personally,
I should have preferred to have deferred publishing
the text, in order to have had an opportunity
of careful and exact comparative study of the piece
in its relation to the Tudor drama as a <i>whole</i> as well
as "<i>play</i>"-meal. On the other hand, I felt that
the generous support we have met with at the
hands of the Society's subscribers would be best
repaid by speedy publication&mdash;"In the city of
Jerusalem ... walled" (<a href="#Page_353">353</a>,<i>c</i>), if the play has
come to us intact, and the lack of continuity is
intentional, the punctuation of this passage must
be altered: delete the full point after <i>called</i> and
regard the next line as a parenthesis, and substitute
a semicolon for the period after <i>walled</i>&mdash;"in the
<i>lane of business</i>" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>a</i>), in original <i>laue</i> of <i>besynesse</i>&mdash;"Yes,
on the left side" (<a href="#Page_354">354</a>,<i>c</i>), <i>Ies</i> in original&mdash;"full
of <i>slouthy</i> bushes" (<a href="#Page_355">355</a>,<i>b</i>), this may be <i>flouthy</i>&mdash;"<i>Fumus</i>
<i>tormentorum</i>" (<a href="#Page_355">355</a>,<i>d</i>), in original <i>Finit</i>:
Latin quotations, <i>supra</i> (<a href="#Page_418">418</a>,<i>d</i>)&mdash;"[<i>Iris</i>]. It is
time for to be walking, &amp;c." (<a href="#Page_356">356</a>,<i>a</i>), these two lines
are not in original given to Irisdision, but form part
of Eugenios' speech, which proceeds without a break
to "Sir William of Trentram" (<a href="#Page_357">357</a>,<i>a</i>). They seem
to me, however, to be rightly restored as now given&mdash;"by
books <i>Amromes</i>" (<a href="#Page_356">356</a>,<i>b</i>), so in original:? a
misprint for <i>amorous</i>, which would at least restore
the sense. There is, moreover, nothing in original
to suggest a break&mdash;"<i>St. John the Evangelist</i>"
(<a href="#Page_357">357</a>,<i>a</i>), preceded by &#10016; instead of the usual "leaf"&mdash;"plain

<p><span class="smcap">Macro Plays and Manuscripts (The).</span> These
derive their name from a former owner, Cox Macro,
an eighteenth century antiquary, physician, and
cleric. From the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
it appears he was born in 1683, and died in 1767.
He was the eldest son of Thos. Macro, grocer and
alderman, and five times Mayor of Bury-St.-Edmunds.
Thos. Macro married Susan, only daughter of Rev.
John Cox, rector of Risby (near Bury-St.-Edmunds).
The son received his name from his mother's surname.
His name was made the subject of a punning
motto for the family&mdash;"Cocks may crow." Educated
at Bury Grammar School, he matriculated at
Jesus College, Cambridge, but migrated to Christ's.
In 1703 he entered at Leyden University, where he
studied under Boerhave. In 1710 he proceeded to
LL.B. degree at Cambridge, and to D.D. in 1717.
He was chaplain to George <span class="smcap">II.</span>, but his possession of
a large fortune rendered him independent of preferment.
Macro was reputed to be master of most
modern languages, and his house at Little Haugh
contained a large collection of artistic treasures.
Macro died 2nd Feb. 1767, and was buried at Norton,
near Bury. A catalogue of Macro's treasures was
compiled in 1766. Among them were many letters
from Protestant martyrs, which came to him through
Bishop Cox; the great register of Bury Abbey; a
ledger-book of Glastonbury Abbey; and the
original MS. of Spenser's <i>View of the State of</i>
<i>Ireland</i>. Many of his MSS. had previously been
the property of Sir Henry Spelman, others formed
part of the library of Bury Abbey. The Macro
property ultimately came to John Patteson, M.P.
for Norwich, who disposed of the old masters
(pictures) in 1819, and sold the books and MSS.
for no more than &pound;150 (it is said) to Richard Beatniffe,
a Norwich bookseller, who resold them at a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
profit. They were sold for Beatniffe by Christie
in 1820, and realised &pound;700, 41 lots going to Dawson
Turner, and the rest to Hudson Gurney. The
latter are now in the possession of J. H. Gurney,
of Keswick Hall, near Norwich, and are described
in the Historical MSS. Commission's 12th Report.
Macro's correspondence with literary men and
artists forms the additional MSS. at the British
Museum, 32556-7. The Rev. Joseph Hunter
edited for the Camden Society in 1840 a volume
of <i>Ecclesiastical Documents</i>, containing 21
charters from Macro's library; and from a MS.
formerly in his possession was printed, in 1837,
for the Abbotsford Club, a morality called <i>Mind,</i>
<i>Will, and Understanding</i>. So far generally the
D.N.B.: the manuscript of the plays alone concern
the present volume. I have not seen the volume
myself, though I hope one day to have the satisfaction
of reproducing it in facsimile. I have
therefore to acknowledge my indebtedness for
the <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> which follows to Mr. A. W. Pollard's
exhaustive account as given in the introduction
to the Early English Text Society's <i>Macro Plays</i>
(Extra Series, xci.). Boiled down, the facts are
these, so far as they relate to the two Macro Plays
included in the present volume, <i>Mankind</i> and
<i>Respublica</i>. <i>Mankind</i> now forms part of a volume
which in the eighteenth century contained other
plays and treatises in manuscript, with which
we need not now concern ourselves, except to
remark the strange juxtaposition of old moralities,
a Juvenal, a treatise on alchemy, etc. When
sold at auction in 1820 the collection was broken
up, and three plays, <i>Mankind</i>, <i>Wisdom</i>, and <i>The</i>
<i>Castle of Perseverance</i>, bound afresh in one volume.
Other points of interest are given by Mr. Pollard,
but which I pass by as not germane to the present
purpose. The manuscript of <i>Mankind</i> and <i>Wisdom</i>
are contemporaneous; and were, says Mr. Pollard,
in the same ownership before the end of the fifteenth
century. This is in all likelihood a fact; but
that the ownership was a purely personal one
is not so clear as appears at first sight, or for the
reasons stated by Mr. Pollard. It is now necessary
for me to quote Mr. Pollard's own words in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
to make my suggestions quite clear. He says: "It
is ... possible that both this play and ... [<i>Wisdom</i>]
were written in different parts of a miscellany-book
belonging to Monk Hyngham, though the
fact that his doggerel inscription of ownership
is written after each of them inclines one at first
to think that they were separate units among
his possessions. As it occurs at the end of this
play [<i>Mankind</i>], the inscription ... has been partly
erased and partly cut through, the lower part
of the leaf being supplied with modern paper.
Enough, however, of the inscription remains to
make it fairly certain that it reads like that at the
end of the next play: O liber si quis cui constas
forte queretur Hyngham q<i>ue</i> monacho dices super
o<i>mn</i>ia, co<i>n</i>sto. This apparently is to be translated
(I owe the suggestion to Dr. Warner): 'O book, if
any one by chance asks to whom do you belong,
you are to say I belong to Hyngham, above everything
which a monk can own.' Who Monk Hyngham
was we do not know. He may have belonged to
Bury-St.-Edmunds, whence some of the Macro
manuscripts are said to have come." Thus far also
Mr. Pollard.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now, I am inclined to think the deductions
hitherto drawn from the foregoing facts are not
altogether of the soundest. In the first place,
<i>Is the inscription rightly translated?</i> Secondly,
<i>Does "Hyngham" refer to a person or a place?</i> In
answer to the first question, I offer an alternative
reading for consideration; in reply to the second,
I offer evidence that a place is meant. If I am
right in my contentions fresh light is thereby thrown
upon several problems, at present unsolved, in
respect to these Macro plays. To take the points
in order. The inscription as given by Mr. Pollard
in his introductory remarks on page xxx, varies
somewhat from the text as given on pages 34 and
73: <i>que</i> is <i>quem</i> and co<i>n</i>sto is given as co<i>n</i>sta[s].
My own text (<a href="#Page_40">40</a>,<i>d</i>) follows the latter, which for
the sake of the ensuing argument I quote again,
with contractions, etc., duly indicated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O liber, si q<i>u</i>is cui co<i>n</i>stas forte q<i>u</i>eret<i>u</i>r,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hyngham, qu<i>em</i> monacho dices, sup<i>er</i> o<i>mn</i>ia co<i>n</i>sta[s].<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>
<p>Now if for qu<i>em</i> we read qu<i>od</i> and for co<i>n</i>sta[s]
we substitute co<i>n</i>sta[t], we get on surer ground.
The original hardly conveys the idea that <i>constas</i>
occurs twice, though there is evidently a play on
"<i>constas</i>," "constat"; at least that is a possible
reading. In this instance, too, the verb <i>constare</i>
seems to be used in the sense of <i>value</i>, and one
hardly sees where Dr. Warner's <i>belong</i> comes in.
If <i>quod</i> and <i>constat</i> are accepted, the translation
would be something like this:</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O book, if haply anyone should ask to what
[place] you are precious, tell them Hyngham,
which [<i>quod</i>] to a monk is precious beyond all
[places]."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That is, the book is precious to Hyngham; Hyngham
is precious beyond all places to the monks.</p>

<p>This brings me to the next point. Assuming
this translation to be correct (and I invite discussion),
it seems pretty clear that the ownership
of the manuscripts of <i>Mankind</i> and <i>Wisdom</i> was
not to a <i>Monk</i> Hyngham, but to a monk or monks
of Hyngham. Facts again seem to confirm alike
this new view and also the Eastern Counties tradition.
Hyngham, Hingham, or Ingham, as a surname,
is not common in the district; on the contrary,
it is uncommonly rare. It belongs more
to the north, especially to Lancashire and Yorkshire.
Its occurrence now-a-days in Leeds, Bradford,
Liverpool, and Manchester, may be regarded as
fifty or sixty to two, or at most three, for other large
towns all over the country; whilst in the Eastern
Counties it is simply not to be found. This is
especially and particularly the case as regards
Lincoln, Grimsby, Boston, Stamford, Norwich,
Yarmouth, Ipswich, Bury-St.-Edmunds, Cambridge,
Colchester, Chelmsford, etc. The facts are at least
significant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, taking Hyngham (or Ingham)
as a place-name, we go, as the kiddies say, from
"cold" to "hot" at once. There are three places
of this name, all comparatively close to one another.
There is Ingham near Bury-St.-Edmunds, Ingham
near Lincoln, and Ingham 16 miles N.E. from
Norwich. I have been unable at present to trace
any ecclesiastical connection with the two Inghams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
first named. But at Ingham near Norwich, Sir
Miles de Stapleton, of Bedale, in Yorkshire, in
the fourteenth century founded a chantry in the
church of Ingham, with a warden and two priests,
in honour of the Holy Trinity. This foundation
afterwards became a priory of friars of the order
of the Holy Trinity, otherwise known as "Trinitarians" or
"Mathurines." At the dissolution there
were seven friars, and a revenue estimated at &pound;63
per annum. "Yngham Trynyte" is twice mentioned
in Bale's <i>Three Laws</i> [Works, E.E.D.S. 34 and 63].
In Carlisle's <i>Topographical Dictionary</i> of England
(1808), Ingham is spoken of as being in the fourteenth
century "a college or priory of the order of the
Holy Trinity." This is as far as I have at present
gone, but I shall not have sought and written in
vain if my remarks lead to further research in
connection with these Macro plays. The new
light certainly tends to confirm Mr. Pollard's dates;
but how far it affects his argument founded on the
collation of the manuscript, I do not know, and
writing, as I do, far away from the great centres of
antiquarian literary research and reference, my
inquiries have been perforce of the slightest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mankind.</span> The text is given on pp. 1-40. This
curious picture of real life and ne'er-do-weels in
late Plantagenet and early Tudor times is one
of the unique Macro plays, and existed, until quite
recently, in manuscript only. With this manuscript
and its history I have dealt fully in another
part of this volume (<i>see</i> Macro Plays and MSS.).
During the last ten years <i>Mankind</i> has been three
times reprinted&mdash;by Dr. Brandl (<i>Quellen</i>, etc., 1904),
by Prof. Manly (<i>Specimens of the Pre-Shakespearean</i>
<i>Drama</i>, 1904), and by the <i>Early English Text Society</i>
(Extra Series xci, 1904). The last-named text
in all probability more nearly approaches fidelity
to the original than the others; but as the amanuensis,
to all appearance, was the same for all three,
and was responsible for the confessedly untrustworthy
texts which Dr. Brandl and Prof. Manly
have been compelled to use without an opportunity
of a new collation with the original manuscript,
one cannot but entertain some misgiving as to
the accuracy of the Early English Text Society's
version. Especially is this the case in view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
the fact that, so far as I can learn, the E.E. text,
as set by the printers from the copy supplied to
them, does not seem to have been compared with
the original MS. The manifold errors too, alike
in the otherwise admirable introductory sketches,
in the footnotes, and in the glossary, are not reassuring.
Quotation after quotation, reference after
reference, are incorrectly given. For example,
in &sect; 2, pp. xi.-xix., there are no less than twelve
errors of this description that have casually come
to my notice; while, having occasion to use the
glossary references more frequently, I have found
its usefulness much more largely impaired. Taking
a column here and there at random, these are the
results:&mdash;page 196, col. 1, 2 errors; 199, col. 2,
1 error; 200, col. 2, 5 references wrong; 210,
col. 1, 4 errors. Why, too, Monk <i>Hyngston</i> (xix.)
instead of <i>Hyngham</i>? And, in reference to this
strange inaccuracy, I must add that the same
Society's edition of <i>Respublica</i> is no better; indeed,
it is worse! One page alone of the Notes (p. 66)
contains no less than four wrong references, and the
weight of Mr. Magnus's argument for an attribution
of the play to Udall is marred by such unaccountable
misquotation of names as <i>Mengrade</i> for <i>Merry-greek</i>
and <i>Mumblecourt</i> for <i>Mumblecrust</i> (both on
page xxi.). Under the circumstances, and being
unable to obtain access to the original manuscript,
my own text must be taken for what it is ultimately
proved. I have, of course, always given greater
weight to the E.E.T.S. version, because it is the
copy nearest to the original (the Brandl and Manly
texts are copies of this copy), but in many cases
Dr. Brandl and Professor Manly have done what
service they could, and good service often, in
suggested and amended readings and restorations.
As no good purpose could, under the circumstances,
have been served in dealing with all the minuti&aelig;
of this kind in an uncertain text, I have confined
my remarks in this respect to the more important
points raised. By punctuation, often and <i>in toto</i>,
I differ from all three, jointly and severally;
varying the interpretation. These I have noted.
But one conclusion is obvious. The texts of these
Macro plays as they stand are not all that scholars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
can desire; and it is to be hoped that permission
may be obtained for a collotype facsimile of the
whole of the plays. The cost would be great,
but I have no doubt that consideration can be
satisfactorily solved. <i>Corrigenda, Suggested Readings,</i>

of this early writer of interludes. The only work
of his extant is <i>Nature</i> (see pp. 43-133). Bale
mentions another interlude not now extant, but
ascribed to Medwall, "Of the Finding of Truth,
carried away by Ignorance and Hypocrisy." This
was diversified by the introduction of a fool, an
innovation which commended it to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> when

<p><span class="smcap">Nature.</span> The text will be found on pages 41-133,
together with a reduced facsimile of the title-page
of the unique copy now in the British Museum
(C34,<i>e</i>54). Bound up with it, at the end of the
volume, are two duplicate leaves. In several places
(see 105,<i>c</i>; 106,<i>d</i>; 112,<i>d</i>; 114,<i>a</i>) the lower margins
have suffered by cutting; otherwise it is a good copy,
but without date, place, or printer's name. It is
well printed, probably by John Rastell, between
1510-20, and is in excellent preservation. When
printing my own text, I was not aware that a
fragment comprising two complete and well-preserved
pages had been discovered in an album
consisting entirely of "Specimens of the English
Printers from Caxton to Robert Barker," which
Sir John Fenn had collected for the completion of
Ames-Herbert's <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, and
which was offered for sale by Mr. Bernard Quaritch
in his Catalogue, No. 237 (pp. 97-99), the price
affixed being &pound;280. For the foregoing particulars I
am indebted to <i>Materialen zur Kunde des alteren</i>
<i>Englischen Dramas</i>, so ably edited by Prof. Bang
of Louvain University and other well-known English,
American, and Continental scholars. I have, so far,
been unable to trace the subsequent history of this
volume; but I am not without hopes, later on, of being
in a position to supply full and detailed particulars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
What more nearly concerns the present purpose is the
fact that in vol. xii. of <i>Materialen</i> are given facsimiles
of parts of each of these two pages, by means of which
two out of the four lines cut away, each on different
pages, have been restored, viz. at 112,<i>d</i> and 114,<i>a</i>&mdash;a
fortunate and happy circumstance (see <i>Corrigenda,</i>
<i>etc., infra</i>). Another fragment was known to
exist at the Bodley. This is mentioned by Mr. Greg
in his <i>Handlist of English Plays</i>; but no particulars
are furnished, and on enquiry at the Bodley no trace
of the fragment could at first be found. I, thereupon,
made search, and at last unearthed it, finding
it buried in a mass of uncatalogued early printed
scraps. This was after delving through a dozen
volumes of similar miscellaneous material, so let it
now be ear-marked for future reference. The Bodley
shelf-mark is Rawl. 4<sup>o</sup> 598 (12). It came into the
Bodleian with the Rawlinson collection of MSS. and
printed books in 1755. The fragment (Aiiii) is small,
and is apparently of the same edition as the British
Museum copy, and the extra leaves. As the Quaritch
fragment is also undoubtedly of similar parentage, it
is unlikely that the play was printed more than
once. The Bodley fragment comprises (<i>a</i>) "But,
if Reason tickle ..." (last line p. 49) down to
" ... that from above is sent" (p. 50, 11th line of
text from bottom); and (<i>b</i>) "No well-advised
body ..." (page 51, 11 lines from top) down to "It
shall not skill as for this intent" (p. 52, 2 lines from
top). By this it will be seen that this recovery does
not serve to restore either of the two missing lines,
not restored by the other fragments. <i>Nature</i> was
produced before Archbishop Morton in Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>'s
reign (see 51,<i>c</i>; 88,<i>b</i>); and Bale states that it was
translated into Latin. A period of nearly three days
seems to have elapsed between the representation
of Parts I. and II. (see 90,<i>d</i>). Other allusions I have
dealt with in this Note-Book as they occur. Of
the author little is known save what is revealed by
the play, and Bale's mention (see <i>Medwall</i>). From
the former it is evident, however, as Prof. Gayley
first pointed out, that he must have possessed a
remarkably vivid imagination, or have enjoyed a
closer acquaintance than might be expected of one
of his cloth with the seamy side of London life; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
there are few racier or more realistic bits of description
in our early literature than the account given
by Sensuality of Fleyng Kat and Margery, of the
perversion of the hero by the latter, and of her
retirement when deserted to that house of "Strayt
Religyon at the Grene Freres hereby," where "all
is open as a gose eye." Dr. Gayley remarks that
though "the plot is not remarkable, nor the mechanism
of it, for almost the only device availed of is
that of feigned names, still the author's insight into
the conditions of low life, his common sense, his
proverbial philosophy, his humorous exhibition of
the morals of the day, and his stray and sudden
shafts at the foibles of his own religious class, would
alone suffice to attract attention to this work. And
even more remarkable than this in the history
of comedy is Medwall's literary style; his versification
excellent and varied, his conversations witty,
idiomatic, and facile. Indeed, he is so far beyond
the ordinary convention that he writes the first bit
of prose to be found in our drama." <i>Nature</i> has only
once before been reprinted in modern times, in
Prof. Brandl's admirable <i>Quellen</i> series. The
present text is taken direct from the British Museum
copy, and has been re-collated with the original
in proof: mere misprints I have, as a rule, not noted.
It is proper to point out that the "Humility" of the
"Names of the Players" (p. 42) appears in the text,
except in one instance, as "Meekness"; likewise
that "Good Occupation" is the "Good Business"
of the text; "Pride" also is occasionally given
as "Pry. Co." <i>Corrigenda, Amended Readings, etc.</i>:
The <i>Names of the Players</i> (<a href="#Page_42">42</a>,<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>), these are

out that a line has been dropped, but there is no
break in the original copy&mdash;"To put him<i>self</i>"
(<a href="#Page_61">61</a>,<i>c</i>), in original <i>selse</i>&mdash;"[<i>He goeth out....</i>]" (<a href="#Page_64">64</a>,<i>d</i>),
considerable confusion exists in the original from
this point to the end of the next page. The lines
beginning "Worldly Affection," "Come hither!"
are assigned to <i>The World</i>, whereas it is clear that
<i>The World</i> goes out, and <i>Mankind</i>, calling to <i>Worldly</i>
<i>Affection</i> (who comes in), continues his speech,
addressing the new comer. From this point the
speeches now given, rightly I think, to <i>Worldly</i>
<i>Affection</i> are in original to <i>The World</i>, except the
last on page 65, which appears as a continuation of
<i>Mankind's</i> speech. I may remark that Dr. Brandl
differs&mdash;"[<i>Pride</i>]. Who dwelleth here" (<a href="#Page_66">66</a>,<i>c</i>),
in original <i>Pry. Co.</i>&mdash;"worn gilt <i>spurs</i> ... cutted

common <i>pleas</i>" (<a href="#Page_71">71</a>,<i>c</i>), original, <i>place</i>&mdash;"Sir! bid
him welcome," etc. (<a href="#Page_72">72</a>,<i>b</i>), in original the catch-cue
to "<i>Sens.</i>" is repeated here; the present interpolated
"direction" makes the action clear&mdash;<i>Man.</i>
Me?" (<a href="#Page_73">73</a>,<i>a</i>), in original <i>Man.</i> is misprinted
as part of text, <i>Man me?</i>&mdash;"The <i>world</i> told me"
(<a href="#Page_73">73</a>,<i>c</i>), read <i>World</i>&mdash;"Where they <i>shall</i>" (<a href="#Page_93">93</a>,<i>b</i>), original
misprinted <i>shalbe</i>&mdash;"Sirs, God speed <i>ye</i>!" (<a href="#Page_112">112</a>,<i>d</i>),
original <i>you</i>&mdash;"[<i>A line has been shaved away at the</i>
<i>foot of the page</i>]" (<a href="#Page_112">112</a>,<i>d</i>), this is now restored from the
Quaritch fragment, "<i>Had I set a done</i> (= adown)
<i>my gear</i>." A line similarly shaved off at 114,<i>a</i> is
also restored by "I <i>wene he wyll be dede</i>"&mdash;"great

(<a href="#Page_128">128</a>,<i>d</i>), this word is cut away at the foot of

<p><span class="smcap">Redford (John)</span>, musician, poet, and writer of interludes,
was, according to Hawkins, organist and
almoner of St. Pauls. Tusser, in his autobiographical
poem, mentions him as master of the
children of St. Paul's about 1535. As a musician,
his instrumental works are well known, consisting
mainly of florid counterpoint upon a plain song.
As master of the children at St. Paul's, it was part
of his duty to provide dramatic entertainments.
A quaint specimen of his skill in this respect is
afforded by his "Wit and Science." This is preserved
among the additional MSS. at the British
Museum (No. 15,233), the memorandum book in
which it is written, and of which the original binding
is still in excellent condition, containing some
musical sketches (possibly memoranda only), and
fragments of two other moralities, one of them in
Redford's name. The date of his death is unknown,
but as Sebastian Westcott was master of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
the children of St. Paul's in 1559, probably Redford
had died before that date.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Respublica.</span> The text is given on pp. 177-272. The
original forms one of the Macro plays in manuscript,
now the property of Mr. J. H. Gurney of Keswick
Hall, near Norwich: see Macro Plays and Manuscripts,
<i>ante</i>. <i>Respublica</i> has been three times previously
printed in modern times&mdash;(<i>a</i>) by Mr. John
Payne Collier in <i>Illustrations of Old English Literature</i>,
I. (1866), B. M. press-mark, 2326, <i>c</i>; (<i>b</i>) by
Prof. Brandl in <i>Quellen</i>, etc. (1904); and (<i>c</i>) by the
Early English Text Society (Extra Series xciv.),
edited by Mr. Leonard A. Magnus, LL.B., "from
Mr. Gurney's unique Macro MS. 115" (1905), B. M.
press-mark, Ac. 9926/60. I do not know how
Mr. Collier got his copy; Dr. Brandl states his copy
was made for him by Dr. Emeke, "and we both
have collated it." Whether the copy was made direct
from the original manuscript, or whether it was
(as in the case of <i>Mankind</i>) (<i>q.v.</i>) a copy of a copy,
or further, whether the collation of the proof-sheets
was with the original or with the copy is not stated:
still even the last is <i>something</i> towards assurance,
for the ways of the modern "comp." and the oversight
of the average "reader" are, at times, passing
strange. Yet Mr. Magnus by his remark, "Prof.
Brandl had to make his edition from a copy of the
manuscript," seems to infer that the German
editor was unable to get into close contact with the
original. This uncertainty is unfortunate, for were
we sure of the contrary, there would have been
immediate and well-founded confidence in the fidelity
of Prof. Brandl's text. But worse remains. Mr.
Magnus, beyond saying that "the manuscript
has been kindly lent by the owner," nowhere, so far
as I can read, mentions that the copy of the same
as prepared for the printers had, when in proof, been
compared with the original manuscript. My own
experience in collating the three copies of <i>Mankind</i>
(<i>q.v.</i>), made respectively for the E.E.T.S., Prof. Manly,
and Prof. Brandl, does not tend to reassure one.
Indeed, the sampling of Mr. Manly's printed sheets
in another direction has convinced me that though
the text may be, and probably is, substantially
accurate, yet it would be folly to waste valuable
time in furnishing, for this play, even the simplest
of textual notes and criticism. Knowing, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
experience, the weighty trustworthiness of Prof.
Brandl's work in respect to other plays, I commenced
by modernising his text, at the same time
collating it with that of Collier, only to find,
when I came to compare it with the E.E.T.
Society's edition, just the same obviously careless
miscripts and blunders that I found when collating
<i>Mankind</i>. This estimate was confirmed when I
tested the value of the work done on <i>Respublica</i>,
apart from the text, in the same fashion that I tested
the worth of <i>Mankind</i>. Taking pages xviii. (four
lines from bottom) to xxii. (two lines from top) of
Mr. Magnus' <i>Introduction</i> (E.E.T.S., Extra Series
xciv.), to prove the accuracy of the quotations and
references, what is the result? In 124 lines there
are no fewer than forty errors in quotation, reference
figures, and the like, or more than one mistake for every
three lines!!! I fear little faith can be placed in the
accuracy of the text of the play when such a result
is forthcoming in respect to the very structure of
the setting. Nor is this an isolated or specially
selected weak spot: these particular pages attracted
attention as providing an obviously distinctive
chance of checking the work done. Turn again
to the glossary references, and taking a column
haphazard, the second column of page 79, and
the same process of verifying the printed page shows
five blunders in thirty-four entries from <i>Cale</i> to
<i>Creature</i>. Or, take page 66 of the notes, and one
reaps four blunders in twelve lines (Notes, l. 439-l. 581)!
I cannot therefore help feeling uncertain
about the text of the play itself, and as I have been
unable, as yet, to get access to the original, I prefer
to save useless labour by sending forth my own text
without comment of any kind. As a matter of course
the E.E.T.S. version is no doubt nearest the
original, and, in doubtful cases I have, equally of
course, followed it in preference to the Collier or
Brandl versions; but it must not be taken as worth
more than it really is. I can only once again
express a sincere hope that some one will in the
near future be allowed to reproduce these invaluable
Macro Plays in facsimile. <i>Respublica</i> is noteworthy
in more respects than one. Obviously
written by a Catholic, it is the Reformation in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
social and political, and not in its doctrinal, aspect
that forms the pivot of the action of the play.
The calmest judgments of posterity incline to the
view that the mainspring of the revolt against the
Papacy in England rested more on zeal as the
tool of worldliness than, as elsewhere, on worldliness
as the tool of zeal. A king whose character was
despotism itself personified, unprincipled ministers,
a rapacious aristocracy, a servile Parliament, such
were the instruments by which England was delivered
from the yoke of Rome. The work which
had been begun by Henry, the murderer of his
wives, was continued by Somerset, the murderer
of his brother, and completed by Elizabeth, the
murderer of her guest. By Reformers and Catholics
alike, religion was made the tool of spoliation,
rapine, and oppression. The Reformation left
the country morally and materially bankrupt, and
Catholic though Mary was, much seems to have been
expected of her by the nation at large. Indeed, the
great mass of the people cared little or nothing for
the factional strife of either camp, except so far as
it affected them from a social point of view. Hence
the <i>motif</i> of <i>Respublica</i> and its curiously moderate
tone. It would really seem that Queen Mary
was possessed of a softness not usually credited
to her, and that she succumbed to political faction
as her brother before her and her sister after her
succumbed. It is, therefore, this aspect&mdash;the social
aspect&mdash;of the great upheaval with which the
author of <i>Respublica</i> is concerned, and no more
pithy or pungent contemporary narrative or satire
exists. Apart from the regrettable shortcomings
of Mr. Magnus' volume in other respects, he has
done useful yeoman service to English scholarships
by tracing and emphasising, point by point, the
action of the play in its relation to political events,
practically identifying the play as a stage version of
the events of the reign of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> I can only
refer my readers to his altogether admirable analysis&mdash;a
statement of fact and resum&eacute; which happily is
not and cannot be marred by the evil influence of
inaccuracy of reference and quotation. Further,
if Mr. Magnus' essay be read in conjunction with
that portion of Hallam's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span><i>Constitutional History of</i>
<i>England</i>, which concerns this period&mdash;Macaulay's
famous review of the same will serve admirably&mdash;and
with Book II. of Burnett's <i>History of the Reformation</i>,
the key will be found to emphasise the points
made by Mr. Magnus, and to illustrate and explain
the political and social allusions with which <i>Respublica</i>
abounds. On the question of authorship,
Mr. Magnus also attempts an attribution, suggesting
Udall, the author of <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>. His
facts and inferences are, to my mind, inconclusive;
as he himself admits. Identity of phraseology,
tricks of style, similarity of orthography, and the
like, are at best uncertain grounds to form the basis
of Tudor attributions. Very shortly the <i>corpus</i>
of pre-Shakespearean drama now in progress will
enable the student to tackle his subject to more
purpose than heretofore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rested</span>, "would have <i>rested</i> me" (IP<a href="#Page_316">316</a>,<i>c</i>), a contracted

<p><span class="smcap">Restority</span>, "it is <i>restority</i>" (R<a href="#Page_222">222</a>,<i>c</i>), restorative;

<p><span class="smcap">Rods</span>, "<i>rods in piss</i>" (R<a href="#Page_219">219</a>,<i>b</i>), a reckoning in store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rond</span>, "<i>rond</i> in your ear" (M<a href="#Page_14">14</a>,<i>c</i>), whisper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Room</span>, "to have with him a <i>room</i>" (N<a href="#Page_49">49</a>,<i>d</i>; 50,<i>a</i>),
post, office, station, position. "To have and enjoy
that office and <i>room</i>."&mdash;Holinshed, <i>Scotland</i> (an.
1543).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Royals</span>, "give us <i>red royals</i>" (M<a href="#Page_21">21</a>,<i>b</i>), <i>i.e.</i> give us
gold, not coppers: <i>red</i> = gold is frequently found
in old writers, though it is now only used in thieves'
slang. The <i>royal</i> was a gold coin of varying value,
from 10s. to 30s.: see other volumes of this series.
"Ich shall not mis of <i>red ones</i> to haue store."&mdash;T.
Howell, <i>Poems</i> (1568), i. 91 (Grosart).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rutter</span>, "A <i>rutter</i>, huffa gallant" (N<a href="#Page_77">77</a>,<i>c</i>), trooper,
horseman: also a swaggering, dashing gallant.
That this last mentioned is the sense is clear from
the phrase <i>huffa gallant</i>, which in old writers is
commonly put into the mouths of roisterers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
dashing men of fashion: see <i>Four Elements</i>, <i>Hickscorner</i>,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rutterkin</span>, "what <i>rutterkin</i> have we here" (IP<a href="#Page_332">332</a>,<i>b</i>),
a rutter: see previous entry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sad</span>, "<i>sad</i> a-sleep" (M<a href="#Page_26">26</a>,<i>c</i>), sound, firm, not to be
easily awakened. "It was founded on a <i>sad</i> stoon."&mdash;Wyclif,
Luke vi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Audrey</span>, "<i>St. Audrey's</i> holy bend" (M<a href="#Page_28">28</a>,<i>a</i>),
<i>bend</i> = band: see Nares, <i>s.v.</i> Tawdry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Catherine's</span> (JE<a href="#Page_361">361</a>,<i>c</i>). This is probably
St. Catherine's near Guildford, which was one of
the stations on the "Pilgrim's way" from Winchester
to Canterbury, the route lying also through
Kent. From St. Catherine's, which stands on a
knoll just to the south of Guildford, the "way"
leads up through "The Chantries" to St. Martha's
Chapel, which crowns a considerable hill, thence
proceeding eastward into Kent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Chad</span> (IP<a href="#Page_336">336</a>,<i>c</i>). Of course this saint was picked
for the rhyme's sake. St. Chad was better known
by his Saxon name of St. Ceadda, a Northumbrian
by birth. His early life was spent in a monastery
in Ireland. In 664 he succeeded Bishop Cedda,
his brother, as abbot of Lastingham. Subsequently
he became Bishop of York, but resigned the bishopric
on a question arising as to the regularity of his
consecration, retiring to his old office at Lastingham.
On the death of Jaruman, bishop of Mercia, Ceadda
was induced to enter the episcopate once more.
He died at Lichfield in 672. He has always been
a popular saint in the English Calendar, his festival
falling on the 2nd March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Charity</span> (M<a href="#Page_11">11</a>,<i>b</i>), see <i>Anon. Plays</i> (E.E.D.S.),
3 Ser., 293,<i>d</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Gabriel's Mother</span> (M<a href="#Page_35">35</a>,<i>b</i>), perhaps a reference
to the Virgin Mary. There are three St. Gabriels,
of whom the one recognised in the gnostic systems
is the more likely. He was the angel specially
associated with the conception of the Virgin Mary,
and according to some versions was Jesus Himself
taking the form of the angel Gabriel for the purpose
of preparing the Virgin, in a physical sense, for the
miraculous conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint George</span>, "<i>Saint George thee borrow</i>" (R<a href="#Page_208">208</a>,<i>a</i>),
whether merely used as a salutation or referring
to some song is not clear: as regards the phrase,
see Udal, <i>Works</i> (E.E.D.S.), 146,<i>d</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Hugh</span> (IP<a href="#Page_341">341</a>,<i>a</i>). There are no less than <i>four</i>
St. Hughs who were bishops, viz.:&mdash;Hugh, 9th
Bishop of Geneva, early in 7th century; Hugh,
13th Bishop of Alby, said to have been in possession
of the See when the Saracens took the city in 722;
Hugh, 37th Bishop of Paris, died in 730; Hugh,
18th Bishop of S&eacute;ez, in latter half of 8th century.
There is also a legendary St. Hugh, patron of the
Abbey of Tewkesbury, who is said to have buried
Brihtric, King of Mercia, in the chapel of St. Faith
at Tewkesbury, and to have been buried there
himself in 812. According to <i>Dictionary of Christian</i>
<i>Biography</i>, the story is an impudent fabrication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Quintin</span> (M<a href="#Page_13">13</a>,<i>b</i>) came into Gaul with St.

<p><span class="smcap">Sallet</span>, "for lack of a <i>sallet</i>" (R<a href="#Page_229">229</a>,<i>b</i>), a light helmet,
chiefly used by foot-soldiers in the fifteenth century:
see God's Good. "Many a time, but for a <i>sallet</i>,

<p><span class="smcap">Scoured</span>, "<i>scoured</i> a pair of fetters" (M<a href="#Page_28">28</a>,<i>d</i>), a very
common piece of Old Cant = to go, or lie, in, or wear
fetters: usually, "to <i>scour</i> the cramp-rings or

<p><span class="smcap">Sereful</span>, "a <i>sereful</i> man" (N<a href="#Page_81">81</a>,<i>c</i>), I suspect from
the context that this is a misprint for fearful = full
of fear, timid. Or it may be akin to the use
of <i>sere</i> by Ascham, characterised by Nares as
"peculiar" to that writer = individual, particular,
single: whence <i>sereful</i> would mean "peculiar,"
"full of idiosyncracies," "difficult."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trentham (Sir William of Trentham)</span>. As already
stated (see <i>John Evangelist</i>) the entrances and
exits, and the connection between different parts
of this play of <i>John the Evangelist</i>, are by no means
obvious. At 356,<i>b</i>, Eugenio, referring to Irisdision,
says he may well be called "witless Sir Will";
and when Eugenio speaks of the coming of Sir
William of Trentham (<a href="#Page_357">357</a>,<i>a</i>), in comes John the Evangelist.
The most feasible explanation is that the
part of John the Evangelist was played by a parish
priest whose name was Sir William of Trentham.
The clerical use of <i>Sir</i> = <i>dominus</i> is common,
but the only reference I can find to Trentham
(near Stoke-on-Trent) is in the 5th volume
of "<i>Magna Britannia</i>," pp. 92 and 154. In both
places there is mention of a monastery of "Canons
Regular of St. Augustine," built in the reign of
William Rufus. According to Dugdale and Speed
it was valued, at the time of the dissolution, at
&pound;106, 3s. 10d. per annum. As the rule of the
Augustines enjoins poverty, chastity, and humility,
my suggestion receives confirmation of a sort at
359,<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, where "wilful poverty" is enjoined.
As regards Irisdision, who is obviously the same
as John the Evangelist and Sir William of Trentham,
this is a puzzle. Eugenio is Greek, but an attempt
at making Greek of Irisdision is not quite satisfactory,
and may seem somewhat far-fetched.
<i>Iris</i> in Greek mythology was a messenger of the
gods, who are sometimes noted collectively by

I have perforce followed the first-named as the most
likely to be according to the original, but in view
of the uncertainty as to the accuracy of either transcript,
little can be said (see <i>Mankind</i>). Manly (whom
the E.E. Text editors follow) suggests <i>vij</i> (<i>or xx</i>)
<i>devellys</i>; Brandl <i>dewellys</i>? The phrasing is suggestive,
"worship" (cf. "worship of the new year":
see <i>New Year</i>), and "v vowels," which of course
is distinctive, but I am quite at a loss to suggest
an explanation. If the allusion is to gaming,
<i>vowels</i> may be a miscript for <i>volvelles</i>, quite a different
word. Whitney says of it&mdash;"A small and generally
circular movable plate affixed to an engraving
containing a dial or lottery, and made to carry
the index hand or pointer." There is a paragraph
in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (Sixth Series, vol. xi. p. 217)
referring to "volvelles," and it seems pretty evident
from this that they were well known as instruments
of chance; there is an allusion in Withers' <i>Emblems</i>,
where he makes use of the "Index" or "volvelle"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The collation is sixteen leaves, Ai (title with back
blank) to Div. in 4s. The play is wretchedly printed
on very thin paper, and simply bristles with printer's
errors. I have taken no heed of most of these
in the present text which I have collated twice
with the old copy. I think I have succeeded in
producing a substantially correct version of the
original, any specially doubtful point being noted
<i>infra</i>. This, however, must be taken with one
reservation&mdash;so far as the state of the typography
would allow I have given the Dutch and Spanish
jargon exactly as it appears in the old text. It
was simply impossible to make sense out of it.
Many of the words have no resemblance to anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
in Dutch. It was submitted to Dutch and German
scholars to no effect. The sense occasionally
can be gleaned&mdash;for example, that Hance was a
drunken Hollander who wanted to get an engagement
as gunner by the English. But the whole
is evidently a caricature of Dutch, with which
the author obviously had no acquaintance beyond
a few scattered words, and the "patter" was put
in simply to tickle the ears of the groundlings. As
regards date, the British Museum Catalogue suggests
"? 1565" for this recovered copy; but Hazlitt
states that the play was licensed in 1557-8, and
printed by John Waley in 1558. There is little
internal evidence to help to a decision. Hance
(<a href="#Page_300">300</a>,<i>c</i>) says he has been in England "this darteen
(thirteen) year," and if we deduct this from 1557-8
we get 1544-5, which is close enough to the times
of Anne of Cleves (1540), the "Flander's mare"
of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, to suggest that the play may have
been written and played a year or two earlier than
the date of its entry at Stationers' Hall. There
are two references to the Sovereign (<a href="#Page_301">301</a>,<i>b</i> and 308,<i>d</i>),
Queen Elizabeth, who succeeded 17th Nov. 1558,
but these allusions do not, of course, reveal anything.
<i>Corrigenda, Amended Readings, etc.</i>: Title-page
(274), a reduced facsimile being given (273), direct
comparison may be made: though very indistinct,
there are traces of the lines of a written inscription
on the lower half of the page&mdash;<i>Names of Players</i>
(275 <i>et seq.</i>), these are given in margin; in places
dropped a little out of line, but nowhere so that
the commencement of the speech is not easily
identified&mdash;"praise yourself <i>too</i> much ye may"
(<a href="#Page_276">276</a>,<i>a</i>), original <i>so</i>&mdash;"<i>Yet</i> no displeasure" (<a href="#Page_276">276</a>,<i>b</i>),
original <i>Yeth</i>&mdash;"to you no <i>dispraise</i>" (<a href="#Page_276">276</a>,<i>b</i>), in
original <i>dyspayre</i>&mdash;"am I a <i>tagetive</i>" (<a href="#Page_277">277</a>,<i>c</i>), original
<i>tagetyve</i>, but the first "<i>stamp</i>" may be anything:
see <i>Tagetive</i>&mdash;"I, Wealth, <i>have</i> all treasure"
(<a href="#Page_278">278</a>,<i>a</i>), original <i>hatg</i>: the close alphabetical juxtaposition
of <i>v</i> and <i>t</i> on the one hand and <i>e</i> and <i>g</i>
of the misprint (for so I take it) is curious: see
<i>supra</i>&mdash;"<i>their</i> pain is such" (<a href="#Page_280">280</a>,<i>c</i>), original <i>there</i>&mdash;"<i>Ill-W.</i>
Why, I came," etc. (<a href="#Page_284">284</a>,<i>a</i>), throughout

"tagged" in the margin <i>Will</i>&mdash;"<i>H</i>[<i>eal</i>]<i>th.</i> Whose,"
etc. (<a href="#Page_284">284</a>,<i>a</i>), the letters in square brackets are
rubbed away, but the speech seems to be to Health
rather than Wealth. See Health's speech, 283,<i>b</i>.&mdash;"and

the letters are blurred, but the portions visible
indicate the rubbed-out strokes: if so, note the
three rhymes, <i>were</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>mar</i>: Dr. Murray gives
<i>mer</i>(<i>e</i>) as a form current from the 13th to the 16th
centuries&mdash;"I <i>came</i> my way" (<a href="#Page_286">286</a>,<i>c</i>), original
<i>can</i>&mdash;"<i>Ill-W.</i> I would come in" (<a href="#Page_286">286</a>,<i>c</i>), in original
this speech is given to Wit, but clearly that is a
mistake&mdash;"<i>Hance</i> Beerpot, a scon router" (<a href="#Page_287">287</a>,<i>a</i>),
so in original, which there seemed no need to modernise
to Hans: see <i>ante</i>&mdash;"his name is War" (<a href="#Page_287">287</a>,<i>c</i>),
in view of recent discussion in <i>N. and Q.</i> note the
rhyme with <i>mar</i>&mdash;"with your <i>gound? stand near</i>"
(<a href="#Page_287">287</a>,<i>c</i>), this may possibly read "with your gound-stand
near?"&mdash;"I am very glad" (<a href="#Page_289">289</a>,<i>d</i>), the next
line is very indistinct, and even the paper at this
place is opaquer than elsewhere, so debarring
restoration in that wise: it <i>looks</i> like "Some
crafty wile for him [I would] ye had," but <i>I would</i>
is very doubtful, unless we reckon on a glaring
misprint&mdash;"they shall not <i>flit</i>" (<a href="#Page_290">290</a>,<i>c</i>), original
<i>flye</i>&mdash;"[<i>Health</i>]. Sirs! now go your way" (<a href="#Page_291">291</a>,<i>c</i>),
the name is not in original, but the lines are apparently
as now attributed&mdash;"<i>w'out</i> blane" (<a href="#Page_294">294</a>,<i>b</i>),
<i>wout</i> in original&mdash;"If a man be never so...."
(<a href="#Page_295">295</a>,<i>a</i>), the line appears to have got loose, and
in printing this has caused extra blurring: <i>so</i>
may not be correct; what follows looks like
"so ... good and b ... be but thrifty":
but it is uncertain to a degree&mdash;"Speak! be not
<i>afraid</i>" (<a href="#Page_295">295</a>,<i>d</i>), in original <i>afryde</i>&mdash;"What <i>sayest</i>
thou in his face" (<a href="#Page_296">296</a>,<i>a</i>), obviously misprinted
in the original: the word meant may be <i>seest</i>&mdash;"for

which seems worth quoting, as exemplifying the
survival in Tudor-English dialect of an A.S. word
that itself had only a limited vogue. "In South-Western
dialect, <i>widge</i>, a horse (mare) ... from
M.E. <i>wig</i>, A.S. <i>wicg</i>. The ... word is only
found in poetry, and with moderate frequency;
while in other Teutonic languages <i>wigg</i>, horse, occurs
solely, to my knowledge, in O. Sax., <i>The Heliand</i>,
and there but once. Stratmann's <i>Mid. Eng.</i>
<i>Dictionary</i> (ed. H. Bradley) gives a solitary example
of <i>wig</i>, horse, in <i>Early English Homilies</i> (ed. R.
Morris), rendering the more notable its survival
to the above date. The word is not in Halliwell's
<i>Dictionary</i>." (H. P. L.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wit and Science, by John Redford</span>. The text,
collated anew in proof with the original manuscript in
the British Museum (Add. MSS. 15,233), will be found
on pages 135-175, together with a reduced facsimile
of the penultimate page of the manuscript (p. 136),
and the concluding lines of the same with Redford's
signature (p. 175). This last facsimile has been
included because nowhere in the Museum Catalogue
does Redford's name occur; the play has never
been catalogued as his though his name appears
both in the MS. and in the Shak. Soc. reprint (Ac.
9485.33). A good deal of confusion and uncertainty
has existed concerning the identity of this and two
other Wit plays, a question which I discuss in
<i>Anon. Plays</i> (E.E.D.S.), <i>Series IV.</i>, now in the
press. I refer the reader to this volume, which will
reach subscribers in due course. Besides the
Shakespeare Society's reprint, Prof. Manly has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
included <i>Wit and Science</i> in his <i>Specimens of the</i>
<i>Pre-Shakespearean Drama</i>. The MS. is in the
shape of a memorandum book, the lines running
across the short width of the page. There has been
no cutting of the margins. It was purchased at
the sale of the Bright MSS. in 1844, and the binding
is without doubt contemporary with the MS.,
though it has apparently been patched here and
there. <i>Corrigenda, Amended Readings, etc.</i>: "The

small, between the speakers' names as if by an
afterthought, is written, "Al go out save Honest"&mdash;"Sure
call a blow or twain" (<a href="#Page_162">162</a>,<i>d</i>), Halliwell says
"the scribe here began to write the preceding
speech of Science but erased it." Reference to the
manuscript shows that the previous line originally
ran, "By the mass, <i>madam, ye can no good</i>," and
that the words in italics were then crossed through
and the line re-written as in the present text. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
next line, commencing "And thou shalt sure," etc.,
has apparently been written in after the mistake
was discovered; it occurs at the end of a page. At
the top of the next page of the MS. the word "Art"
is written, and then crossed through, as if the writer
had begun to write the lines ascribed to Science
(<a href="#Page_162">162</a>,<i>d</i>) commencing "Art a-swearing, too?"&mdash;"Welcome,
mine own" (<a href="#Page_171">171</a>,<i>c</i>), in the MS. this song
appears in another part of the book quite distinct

sung here it is restored to its place. Therefore the
stage directions <i>supra</i> and <i>infra</i> (<a href="#Page_171">171</a>,<i>c</i>, 172,<i>d</i>) are
